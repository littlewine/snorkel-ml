9262477|t|Functional role of high-affinity anandamide transport, as revealed by selective inhibition.
9262477|a|Anandamide, an endogenous ligand for central cannabinoid receptors, is released from neurons on depolarization and rapidly inactivated. Anandamide inactivation is not completely understood, but it may occur by transport into cells or by enzymatic hydrolysis. The compound N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)arachidonylamide (AM404) was shown to inhibit high-affinity anandamide accumulation in rat neurons and astrocytes in vitro, an indication that this accumulation resulted from carrier-mediated transport. Although AM404 did not activate cannabinoid receptors or inhibit anandamide hydrolysis, it enhanced receptor-mediated anandamide responses in vitro and in vivo. The data indicate that carrier-mediated transport may be essential for termination of the biological effects of anandamide, and may represent a potential drug target.

10564681|t|Glutathione S-transferase mu and theta polymorphisms and breast cancer susceptibility.
10564681|a|BACKGROUND: The enzymes encoded by the glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) and theta 1 (GSTT1) genes are involved in the metabolism (mainly inactivation, but activation is possible) of a wide range of carcinogens that are ubiquitous in the environment; the enzyme encoded by the GSTT1 gene may also be active in endogenous mutagenic processes. Homozygous deletions of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes are commonly found in the population and result in a lack of enzyme activity. This study was undertaken to evaluate the association between GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms and breast cancer risk. METHODS: Our study included 466 women with incident cases of breast cancer occurring from May 1989 through May 1994 and 466 matched control subjects. These individuals were part of a prospective cohort of U.S. women (i.e., the Nurses' Health Study). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between genetic polymorphisms and breast cancer risk. RESULTS: The GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes were not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.05 [95% CI = 0.80-1.37] for GSTM1 null; OR = 0. 86 [95% CI = 0.61-1.21] for GSTT1 null). On the contrary, a suggestion of a decreased risk of breast cancer associated with the GSTT1 null genotype was observed among premenopausal women. When considered together, no combination of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The relationship between GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene deletions and breast cancer risk was not substantially modified by cigarette smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence against a substantially increased risk of breast cancer associated with GSTM1 and/or GSTT1 homozygous gene deletions.

17446435|t|The troponin C G159D mutation blunts myofilament desensitization induced by troponin I Ser23/24 phosphorylation.
17446435|a|Striated muscle contraction is regulated by the binding of Ca(2+) to the N-terminal regulatory lobe of the cardiac troponin C (cTnC) subunit in the troponin complex. In the heart, beta-adrenergic stimulation induces protein kinase A phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) at Ser23/24 to alter the interaction of cTnI with cTnC in the troponin complex and is critical to the regulation of cardiac contractility. We investigated the effect of the dilated cardiomyopathy linked cTnC Gly159 to Asp (cTnC-G159D) mutation on the development of Ca(2+)-dependent tension and ATPase rate in whole troponin-exchanged skinned rat trabeculae. Even though this mutation is located in the C-terminal lobe of cTnC, the G159D mutation was demonstrated to depress ATPase activation and filament sliding in vitro. The effects of this mutation within the cardiac myofilament are unknown. Our results demonstrate that the cTnC-G159D mutation by itself does not alter the myofilament response to Ca(2+) in the cardiac muscle lattice. However, in the presence of cTnI phosphorylated at Ser23/24, which reduced Ca(2+) sensitivity and enhanced cross-bridge cycling in controls, cTnC-G159D specifically blunted the phosphorylation induced decrease in Ca(2+)-sensitive tension development without altering cross-bridge cycling. Measurements in purified troponin confirmed that this cTnC-G159D blunting of myofilament desensitization results from altered Ca(2+)-binding to cTnC. Our results provide novel evidence that modification of the cTnC-cTnI interaction has distinct effects on troponin Ca(2+)-binding and cross-bridge kinetics to suggest a novel role for thin filament mutations in the modulation of myofilament function through beta-adrenergic signaling as well as the development of cardiomyopathy.

10092622|t|A single amino acid change (substitution of glutamate 3 with alanine) in the N-terminal region of rat liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase I abolishes malonyl-CoA inhibition and high affinity binding.
10092622|a|We have recently shown by deletion mutation analysis that the conserved first 18 N-terminal amino acid residues of rat liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (L-CPTI) are essential for malonyl-CoA inhibition and binding (Shi, J., Zhu, H., Arvidson, D. N. , Cregg, J. M., and Woldegiorgis, G. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 11033-11038). To identify specific residue(s) involved in malonyl-CoA binding and inhibition of L-CPTI, we constructed two more deletion mutants, Delta12 and Delta6, and three substitution mutations within the conserved first six amino acid residues. Mutant L-CPTI, lacking either the first six N-terminal amino acid residues or with a change of glutamic acid 3 to alanine, was expressed at steady-state levels similar to wild type and had near wild type catalytic activity. However, malonyl-CoA inhibition of these mutant enzymes was reduced 100-fold, and high affinity malonyl-CoA binding was lost. A mutant L-CPTI with a change of histidine 5 to alanine caused only partial loss of malonyl-CoA inhibition, whereas a mutant L-CPTI with a change of glutamine 6 to alanine had wild type properties. These results demonstrate that glutamic acid 3 and histidine 5 are necessary for malonyl-CoA binding and inhibition of L-CPTI by malonyl-CoA but are not required for catalysis.

14766010|t|Estrogen receptor-alpha interaction with the CREB binding protein coactivator is regulated by the cellular environment.
14766010|a|The p160 coactivators, steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), transcriptional intermediary factor-2 (TIF2) and receptor-associated coactivator-3 (RAC3), as well as the coactivator/integrator CBP, mediate estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha)-dependent gene expression. Although these coactivators are widely expressed, ERalpha transcriptional activity is cell-type dependent. In this study, we investigated ERalpha interaction with p160 coactivators and CBP in HeLa and HepG2 cell lines. Basal and estradiol (E2)-dependent interactions between the ERalpha ligand-binding domain (LBD) and SRC-1, TIF2 or RAC3 were observed in HeLa and HepG2 cells. The extents of hormone-dependent interactions were similar and interactions between each of the p160 coactivators and the ERalpha LBD were not enhanced by 4-hydroxytamoxifen in either cell type. In contrast to the situation for p160 coactivators, E2-dependent interaction of the ERalpha LBD with CBP or p300 was detected in HeLa but not HepG2 cells by mammalian two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays, indicating that the cellular environment modulates ERalpha-CBP/p300 interaction. Furthermore, interactions between CBP and p160 coactivators are much more robust in HeLa than HepG2 cells suggesting that poor CBP-p160 interactions are insufficient to support ERalpha-CBP-p160 ternary complexes important for nuclear receptor-CBP interactions. Alterations in p160 coactivators or CBP expression between these two cell types did not account for differences in ERalpha-p160-CBP interactions. Taken together, these data revealed the influence of cellular environment on ERalpha-CBP/p300 interactions, as well as CBP-p160 coactivator binding, and suggest that these differences may contribute to the cell specificity of ERalpha-dependent gene expression.

9915329|t|Inhibitory effects of diazepam and midazolam on Ca2+ and K+ channels in canine tracheal smooth muscle cells.
9915329|a|BACKGROUND: Benzodiazepines have a direct bronchodilator action in airway smooth muscle, but the mechanisms by which these agents produce muscle relaxation are not fully understood. The current study was performed to identify the effects of the benzodiazepines diazepam and midazolam on Ca2+ and K+ channels in canine tracheal smooth muscle cells. METHODS: Whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques were used to evaluate the effects of the benzodiazepines diazepam (10(-8) to 10(-3) M) and midazolam (10(-8) to 10(-3) M) on inward Ca2+ and outward K+ channel currents in dispersed canine tracheal smooth muscle cells. The effects of the antagonists flumazenil (10(-5) M) and PK11195 (10(-5) M) on these channels were also studied. RESULTS: Each benzodiazepine tested significantly inhibited Ca2+ currents in a dose-dependent manner, with 10(-6) M diazepam and 10(-5) M midazolam each causing approximately 50% depression of peak voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents. Both benzodiazepines promoted the inactivated state of the channel at more-negative potentials. The Ca2+-activated and voltage-dependent K+ currents were inhibited by diazepam and midazolam (> 10(-5) M and > 10(-4) M, respectively). Flumazenil and PK11195 had no effect on these channel currents or on the inhibitory effects of the benzodiazepines. CONCLUSIONS: Diazepam and midazolam had inhibitory effects on voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, which lead to muscle relaxation. However, high concentrations of these agents were necessary to inhibit the K+ channels. The lack of antagonized effects of their antagonists is related to the non-gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated electrophysiologic effects of benzodiazepines on airway smooth muscle contractility.

11606653|t|The circuitry mediating cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior.
11606653|a|The role of limbic-striato-pallidal circuitry in cocaine-induced reinstatement was evaluated. The transient inhibition of brain nuclei associated with motor systems [including the ventral tegmental area (VTA), dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC), core of the nucleus accumbens (NAcore), and ventral pallidum (VP)] prevented cocaine-induced reinstatement. However, only the VP proved to be necessary for food reinstatement, suggesting that the identified circuit is specific to drug-related reinstatement. Supporting the possibility that the VTA-dPFC-NAcore-VP is a series circuit mediating reinstatement, simultaneous unilateral microinjection of GABA agonists into the dPFC in one hemisphere and into the VP in the contralateral hemisphere abolished cocaine reinstatement. Although dopamine projections from the VTA innervate all three forebrain nuclei, the blockade of dopamine receptors only in the dPFC antagonized cocaine-induced reinstatement. Furthermore, DA administration into the dPFC was sufficient to elicit a reinstatement in drug-related responding. These data demonstrate that dopamine release in the dPFC initiates a dPFC-NAcore-VP series circuit that mediates cocaine-induced drug-seeking behavior.

12941813|t|Products of oxidative DNA damage and repair as possible biomarkers of susceptibility to lung cancer.
12941813|a|The broad spectrum of oxidative DNA damage biomarkers [urinary excretion of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dGuo) and 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OH-Gua)] and the level of oxidative DNA damage and repair in leukocytes DNA were analyzed in three groups of subjects: (a) lung cancer patients [all smokers (n = 51)]; (b) healthy smokers with comparable smoking status (n = 26); and (c) healthy nonsmokers (n = 38). The mean level of 8-OH-Gua in urine samples of 38 healthy nonsmokers reached a value of 1.783 +/- 0.785 nmol/day/kg. This level was significantly lower than that in the urine of the two smoker groups (cancer patients and healthy smokers), in whom the levels reached values of 2.319 +/- 1.271 and 2.824 +/- 0.892 nmol/day/kg, respectively. Urinary excretion of 8-OH-dGuo was similar in all groups of subjects. The level of 8-OH-dGuo in DNA isolated from leukocytes of cancer patients was significantly higher than that in DNA isolated from the group of healthy smokers and nonsmokers (9.44 +/- 4.77 versus 7.20 +/- 2.83 and 5.88 +/- 2.47 molecules/10(6) deoxyguanosine, respectively). Repair activity of 8-OH-Gua, as estimated by the nicking assay, was significantly higher in blood leukocytes of healthy volunteers (44.6 +/- 20.21 and 37.54 +/- 13.43 pmol/h/mg protein for smokers and nonsmokers, respectively) than in the leukocytes of lung cancer patients (24.56 +/- 11.28 pmol/h/mg protein). Because oxidative DNA insult represented by urinary excretion of oxidative DNA lesions was similar in both groups of subjects with similar smoking status, it appears likely that a higher rate of generation of oxidative damage in cellular DNA of lung cancer patients is a result of deficiency of the repair mechanism(s) in this group.

11208686|t|The phytoestrogen genistein produces acute nitric oxide-dependent dilation of human forearm vasculature with similar potency to 17beta-estradiol.
11208686|a|BACKGROUND: Genistein, a phytoestrogen, may have estrogenic cardioprotective actions. We investigated whether genistein influences endothelium-dependent vasodilation in forearm vasculature of healthy human subjects and compared the effects of genistein with those of 17beta-estradiol. METHODS AND RESULTS: The brachial arterial was cannulated with a 27-gauge needle for drug infusion. Forearm blood flow responses were measured with strain-gauge plethysmography. Genistein (10 to 300 nmol/min, each dose for 6 minutes) produced a dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow from 3.4+/-0.3 to 9.6+/-1.3 mL x min(-1) x 100 mL forearm(-1) (mean+/-SEM) in men (n=9, P:<0.0001 by ANOVA). The mean forearm venous concentration of genistein during infusion of the highest dose was 1.8+/-0.3 micromol/L in 6 additional men. Genistein produced a similar increase in blood flow in premenopausal women. Daidzein, another phytoestrogen, was ineffective, but equimolar concentrations of 17beta-estradiol caused similar vasodilation to genistein. Responses to genistein and 17beta-estradiol were inhibited to the same degree by the NO synthase inhibitor N:(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine. A threshold dose of genistein potentiated the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine but not the endothelium-independent vasodilator nitroprusside. CONCLUSIONS: Genistein causes L-arginine/NO-dependent vasodilation in forearm vasculature of human subjects with similar potency to 17beta-estradiol and potentiates endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine.

7955812|t|Metabolism of nicotine to cotinine studied by a dual stable isotope method.
7955812|a|OBJECTIVES: (1) To determine the disposition kinetics of nicotine and cotinine, including the fractional conversion of nicotine to cotinine, (2) to compare the disposition kinetics of deuterium-labeled and unlabeled cotinine, and (3) to develop a pharmacokinetically based method for estimating daily intake of nicotine from cigarette smoking. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty cigarette smokers received a combined infusion of deuterium-labeled nicotine (d2) and cotinine (d4). Six nonsmokers received a combined infusion of unlabeled cotinine, cotinine-d2 and cotinine-d4. Daily intake of nicotine was estimated with use of the plasma cotinine concentration during ad libitum smoking, clearance of labeled cotinine, and fractional conversion of nicotine to cotinine. RESULTS: The kinetics of labeled versus unlabeled cotinine and of cotinine in smokers versus nonsmokers were similar. On average, 72% of nicotine was converted to cotinine, with a range from 55% to 92%. Subjects with lower clearances of nicotine had lower fractional conversion of nicotine to cotinine, indicating that this is the most rapid of the proximate metabolic pathways for nicotine. The equation for estimating daily intake of nicotine from smoking was: Dnic (mg/24 hr) = K x (Plasma Cot) (ng/ml), where K averaged 0.08, with a range from 0.047 to 0.102. Individual variability in the clearance of cotinine (coefficient of variation, 27.5%) accounts for more of the variability in K than does variability in the fractional conversion of nicotine to cotinine (coefficient of variation, 12.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides quantitative data on individual variability in the extent of C-oxidation of nicotine to cotinine and a quantitative perspective on the use of plasma cotinine as an indicator of daily intake of nicotine from tobacco.

10728430|t|Evidence for the stimulatory effect of resveratrol on Ca(2+)-activated K+ current in vascular endothelial cells.
10728430|a|OBJECTIVE: Resveratrol, a natural phytoalexin compound, is present in grapes and wine, and it can produce vasorelaxation. However, little is known of its mechanisms of action on ionic currents in endothelial cells. METHODS: The effect of resveratrol on Ca(2+)-activated K+ currents in an endothelial cell line (HUV-EC-C) originally derived from human umbilical vein was investigated with the aid of the patch-clamp technique. RESULTS: In the whole-cell configuration, resveratrol reversibly increased the amplitude of K+ outward currents. The increase in outward current caused by resveratrol was greatly inhibited by iberiotoxin (200 nM) or paxilline (1 microM), but not by glibenclamide (10 microM), tamoxifen (10 microM), or beta-bungarotoxin (200 nM). Thus, this outward current is believed to be Ca(2+)-activated K+ current (I K(Ca)). In the inside-out configuration, bath application of resveratrol (30 microM) caused no change in the single-channel conductance, but increased the activity of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ (BKCa) channels. Resveratrol enhanced the channel activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The EC50 value for resveratrol-induced channel activity was 20 microM. The resveratrol-stimulated increase in the channel activity was independent of internal Ca2+. Resveratrol (30 microM) also shifted the activation curve of BKCa channels to less positive membrane potentials. The change in the kinetic behavior of BKCa channels caused by resveratrol in these cells in due to an increase in mean open time and a decrease in mean closed time. In a pancreatic islet endothelial cell line (MS1), resveratrol (30 microM) also increased the activity of intermediate-conductance KCa channels. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that in addition to the presence of antioxidative activity, resveratrol can also stimulate KCa channels in endothelial cells. The direct stimulation of these KCa channels by resveratrol may be responsible for its effect on the functional activities of endothelial cells.

19818708|t|Structures of SPOP-substrate complexes: insights into molecular architectures of BTB-Cul3 ubiquitin ligases.
19818708|a|In the largest E3 ligase subfamily, Cul3 binds a BTB domain, and an associated protein-interaction domain such as MATH recruits substrates for ubiquitination. Here, we present biochemical and structural analyses of the MATH-BTB protein, SPOP. We define a SPOP-binding consensus (SBC) and determine structures revealing recognition of SBCs from the phosphatase Puc, the transcriptional regulator Ci, and the chromatin component MacroH2A. We identify a dimeric SPOP-Cul3 assembly involving a conserved helical structure C-terminal of BTB domains, which we call "3-box" due to its facilitating Cul3 binding and its resemblance to F-/SOCS-boxes in other cullin-based E3s. Structural flexibility between the substrate-binding MATH and Cul3-binding BTB/3-box domains potentially allows a SPOP dimer to engage multiple SBCs found within a single substrate, such as Puc. These studies provide a molecular understanding of how MATH-BTB proteins recruit substrates to Cul3 and how their dimerization and conformational variability may facilitate avid interactions with diverse substrates.

20570671|t|Mitochondria and membrane cryoinjury in micropatterned cells: effects of cell-cell interactions.
20570671|a|The maintenance of cell membrane integrity is an absolute minimum criterion for the selection of a successful cryopreservation process; however, it is often used as the sole determinant of cell "viability". Membrane stresses and strains that develop with cell volume fluctuations are only one component of the overall cellular response to freezing. Damage to organelles resulting from excessive concentration of intracellular solutes and/or the alternation of molecular signalling events may affect post-thaw outcomes. As the low temperature response of cells is affected by the presence of cell-cell interactions, the cryopreservation of tissues and tissue model systems would benefit from a more detailed understanding of the sites and mechanisms of cryoinjury. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between mitochondria and plasma membrane damage in frozen micropatterned cells and to identify the role of cell-cell interactions. Madin Darby Canine Kidney cells (MDCK) were micropatterned using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomeric stamp to create non-adhesive regions of agarose on untreated glass substrates. Five different cell arrangements were used to examine the effect of cell-cell contact: single cells, cell doublets, linear arrangement of cells, randomly arranged cells and confluent monolayers. Cells were cooled in a programmable alcohol bath at 1 degrees C/min to -40 degrees C after extracellular ice nucleation at -5 degrees C. Post-thaw plasma membrane integrity and mitochondria depolarization were determined using trypan blue and the lipophilic, cyanine derivative JC-1, respectively. alamarBlue was used to assess the post-thaw metabolic activity of the cell arrangements. We found that the incidence of plasma membrane damage and mitochondria integrity increased with decreasing temperature and was dependent on the degree of cell-cell interaction. Mitochondria damage was evident in cells that displayed intact plasma membranes, however this injury could be reversed in the micropatterned cells that are exposed to suprazero temperatures. The results from this study suggest that the exclusive use of membrane integrity as a measure of cell "viability" does not consider subcellular injury that may contribute to delayed recovery and/or cell death following low temperature exposures.

6306139|t|Lidocaine block of cardiac sodium channels.
6306139|a|Lidocaine block of cardiac sodium channels was studied in voltage-clamped rabbit purkinje fibers at drug concentrations ranging from 1 mM down to effective antiarrhythmic doses (5-20 muM). Dose-response curves indicated that lidocaine blocks the channel by binding one-to-one, with a voltage-dependent K(d). The half-blocking concentration varied from more than 300 muM, at a negative holding potential where inactivation was completely removed, to approximately 10 muM, at a depolarized holding potential where inactivation was nearly complete. Lidocaine block showed prominent use dependence with trains of depolarizing pulses from a negative holding potential. During the interval between pulses, repriming of I (Na) displayed two exponential components, a normally recovering component (tauless than 0.2 s), and a lidocaine-induced, slowly recovering fraction (tau approximately 1-2 s at pH 7.0). Raising the lidocaine concentration magnified the slowly recovering fraction without changing its time course; after a long depolarization, this fraction was one-half at approximately 10 muM lidocaine, just as expected if it corresponded to drug-bound, inactivated channels. At less than or equal to 20 muM lidocaine, the slowly recovering fraction grew exponentially to a steady level as the preceding depolarization was prolonged; the time course was the same for strong or weak depolarizations, that is, with or without significant activation of I(Na). This argues that use dependence at therapeutic levels reflects block of inactivated channels, rather than block of open channels. Overall, these results provide direct evidence for the "modulated-receptor hypothesis" of Hille (1977) and Hondeghem and Katzung (1977). Unlike tetrodotoxin, lidocaine shows similar interactions with Na channels of heart, nerve, and skeletal muscle.

11369623|t|Macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha is an osteoclastogenic factor in myeloma that is independent of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand.
11369623|a|A complementary DNA expression library derived from marrow samples from myeloma patients was recently screened and human macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (hMIP-1alpha) was identified as an osteoclastogenic factor expressed in these samples. hMIP-1alpha enhanced osteoclast (OCL) formation in human marrow cultures and by highly purified OCL precursors in a dose-dependent manner (5-200 pg/mL). Furthermore, hMIP-1alpha enhanced OCL formation induced by human interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is produced by marrow stromal cells when they interact with myeloma cells. hMIP-1alpha also enhanced OCL formation induced by parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL), factors also implicated in myeloma bone disease. Time-course studies revealed that the hMIP-1alpha acted during the last 2 weeks of the 3-week culture period. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the chemokine receptors for hMIP-1alpha (CCR1 and CCR5) were expressed by human bone marrow and highly purified early OCL precursors. Furthermore, hMIP-1alpha did not increase expression of RANKL. These data demonstrate that hMIP-1alpha is an osteoclastogenic factor that appears to act directly on human OCL progenitors and acts at the later stages of OCL differentiation. These data further suggest that in patients with myeloma, MIP-1alpha produced by myeloma cells, in combination with RANKL and IL-6 that are produced by marrow stromal cells in response to myeloma cells, enhances OCL formation through their combined effects on OCL precursors.

3708759|t|Pituitary grafts modify sex differences in liver tumor formation in the rat following initiation with diethylnitrosamine and different promotion regimens.
3708759|a|We previously reported on sex differences in chemical hepatocarcinogenesis studied in the resistant hepatocyte model and on the effects of implantation of ectopic pituitary grafts into male rats on the early stages of liver carcinogenesis. Marked sex differences were found in the area ratio of enzyme-altered foci (mm2 foci/cm2 liver section) in sexually mature male and female Wistar rats (male greater than female). Pituitary grafts implanted one week before 2-acetylaminofluorene selection in male rats decreased the area ratio to a level near that of sham operated females. The present study was performed in order to investigate the relevance of the results in the short-term experiment in terms of hepatoma formation. To study the importance of 2-acetylaminofluorene selection as a determinant of the observed sex differences an experiment was also performed using the Pitot-model, where male and female rats were initiated with diethylnitrosamine and promotion was performed with phenobarbital. The long-term experiments in the resistant hepatocyte model showed that male rats develop hepatomas earlier than female rats and also showed a tendency towards a prolonged latency time in male rats bearing pituitary grafts. A good correspondence was thus achieved between the short-term and the long-term experiments. The rats treated according to the Pitot-model did not develop hepatomas within the experimental period. Of the rats killed at 13 months, three (out of five) male and five (out of five) female rats had hepatocyte nodules whereas, at 19 months two (out of six) male and five (out of six) female rats had developed such lesions in this model. We therefore conclude that 2-acetylaminofluorene is the factor responsible for the sex differences in the resistant hepatocyte model and that the hypothalamo-pituitary influence during 2-acetylaminofluorene selection is an important modifier of the carcinogenetic process.

21655671|t|Factor VII activating protease. Single nucleotide polymorphisms light the way.
21655671|a|Factor VII activating protease (FSAP) is a circulating serine protease with high homology to fibrinolytic enzymes. A role in the regulation of coagulation and fibrinolysis is suspected based on in vitro studies demonstrating activation of FVII or pro-urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). However, considering the paucity of any studies in animal models or any correlative studies in humans the role of FSAP in haemostasis remains unclear. In relation to vascular remodeling processes or inflammation it has been convincingly shown that FSAP interacts with growth factors as well as protease activated receptors (PAR). Against this sparse background there are a plethora of studies which have investigated the linkage of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the FSAP gene (HABP2) to various diseases. The G534E SNP of FSAP is associated with a low proteolytic activity due to an amino acid exchange in the protease domain. This and other SNPs have been linked to carotid stenosis, stroke as well as thrombosis in the elderly and plaque calcification. These SNP analyses indicate an important role for FSAP in the regulation of the haemostasis system as well as fibroproliferative inflammatory processes.

14578209|t|Progression to malignancy in the polyoma middle T oncoprotein mouse breast cancer model provides a reliable model for human diseases.
14578209|a|Animal models are powerful tools to analyze the mechanism of the induction of human breast cancer. Here we report a detailed analysis of mammary tumor progression in one mouse model of breast cancer caused by expression of the polyoma middle T oncoprotein (PyMT) in the mammary epithelium, and its comparison to human breast tumors. In PyMT mice, four distinctly identifiable stages of tumor progression from premalignant to malignant stages occur in a single primary tumor focus and this malignant transition is followed by a high frequency of distant metastasis. These stages are comparable to human breast diseases classified as benign or in situ proliferative lesions to invasive carcinomas. In addition to the morphological similarities with human breast cancer, the expression of biomarkers in PyMT-induced tumors is also consistent with those associated with poor outcome in humans. These include a loss of estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as integrin-beta1 expression and the persistent expression of ErbB2/Neu and cyclinD1 in PyMT-induced tumors as they progress to the malignant stage. An increased leukocytic infiltration was also closely associated with the malignant transition. This study demonstrates that the PyMT mouse model is an excellent one to understand the biology of tumor progression in humans.

20354518|t|Probing cellular events, one quantum dot at a time.
20354518|a|Monitoring the behavior of single molecules in living cells is a powerful approach to investigate the details of cellular processes. Owing to their optical, chemical and biofunctional properties, semiconductor quantum dot (QD) probes promise to be tools of choice in this endeavor. Here we review recent advances that allow ever more controlled experiments at the single-nanoparticle level in live cells. Several examples, related to membrane dynamics, cell signaling or intracellular transport, illustrate how single QD tracking can be readily used to decipher complex biological processes and address key concepts that underlie cellular organization and dynamics.

19793963|t|Control of NMDA receptor function by the NR2 subunit amino-terminal domain.
19793963|a|NMDA receptors comprised of different NR2 subunits exhibit strikingly unique biophysical and pharmacological properties. Here, we report that the extracellular amino-terminal domain (ATD) of the NR2 subunit controls pharmacological and kinetic properties of recombinant NMDA receptors, such as agonist potency, deactivation time course, open probability (P(OPEN)), and mean open/shut duration. Using ATD deletion mutants of NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, NR2D, and chimeras of NR2A and NR2D with interchanged ATD [NR2A-(2D-ATD) and NR2D-(2A-ATD)], we show that the ATD contributes to the low glutamate potency of NR2A-containing NMDA receptors and the high glutamate potency of NR2D-containing receptors. The ATD influences the deactivation time courses of NMDA receptors, as removal of the ATD from NR2A slows the deactivation rate, while removal of the ATD from NR2B, NR2C and NR2D accelerates the deactivation rate. Open probability also is influenced by the ATD. Removal of the ATD from NR2A or replacement of the NR2A-ATD with that of NR2D decreases P(OPEN) in single-channel recordings from outside-out patches of HEK 293 cells. In contrast, deletion of the ATD from NR2D or replacement of the NR2D ATD with that of NR2A increases P(OPEN) and mean open duration. These data demonstrate the modular nature of NMDA receptors, and show that the ATD of the different NR2 subunits plays an important role in fine-tuning the functional properties of the individual NMDA receptor subtypes.

2675861|t|Rodent models of alcoholism: a review.
2675861|a|Four criteria should be fulfilled when establishing an animal model of alcoholism. (1) The animal should voluntarily and selectively consume a solution of the drug to yield pharmacologically significant blood alcohol concentrations. When ethanol is consumed for several weeks under these conditions, (2) the animals should exhibit tolerance to the acute effects of the drug. Furthermore, (3) abrupt termination of drug administration should result in physical signs of drug withdrawal (e.g. audiogenic seizures). (4) Changes in endocrine and liver function would also be expected to occur following the chronic administration of alcohol, such effects being particularly pronounced if the diet of the animal is nutritionally deficient. A number of self-administration, operant conditioning and forced alcohol administration models are critically assessed. A detailed description of the models in which rodents are forced to consume increasing quantities of alcohol as part of a nutritionally enriched milk diet suggests that this method fulfils most of the above criteria.

12490602|t|Attenuation of amiodarone-induced pulmonary fibrosis by vitamin E is associated with suppression of transforming growth factor-beta1 gene expression but not prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction.
12490602|a|Amiodarone (AM) is an efficacious antidysrhythmic agent that can cause numerous adverse effects, including potentially life-threatening pulmonary fibrosis. The current study was undertaken to investigate potential protective mechanisms of vitamin E against AM-induced pulmonary toxicity (AIPT) in the hamster. Three weeks after intratracheal administration of AM (1.83 micromol), increased pulmonary hydroxyproline content and histological damage were observed, indicative of fibrosis. These effects were preceded by increased pulmonary levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 mRNA at 1 week post-AM, which remained elevated 3 weeks post-AM. Dietary supplementation with vitamin E resulted in rapid pulmonary accumulation of the vitamin, and prevention of AM-induced increases in TGF-beta1, hydroxyproline, and histological damage. Although dietary supplementation also markedly elevated lung mitochondrial vitamin E content, it did not attenuate AM-induced inhibition of mitochondrial respiration or disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential in vitro, or lung mitochondrial respiratory inhibition resulting from in vivo AM administration. These results suggest that vitamin E reduces the extent of pulmonary damage after AM administration via down-regulating TGF-beta1 overexpression but that it does not modify AM-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, a potential initiating event in AIPT.

11815381|t|Comparison of the affinity of beta-blockers for two states of the beta 1-adrenoceptor in ferret ventricular myocardium.
11815381|a|We compared the potency of 11 clinically available beta-blockers as antagonists of the positive inotropic effects of (-)-isoprenaline and CGP12177 on ferret ventricular myocardium. (-)-CGP12177, (-)-pindolol and (-)-alprenolol were non-conventional partial agonists with intrinsic activity of 0.7, 0.2 and 0.1 respectively. All beta-blockers antagonized in a concentration-dependent and surmountable manner the positive inotropic effects of both (-)-isoprenaline and CGP12177. The potency of each beta-blocker was consistently higher against (-)-isoprenaline than against CGP12177. Two groups of beta-blockers were identified. In one group the difference between the pK(B) values of blockade against (-)-isoprenaline and CGP12177 was 1.1 - 1.6 log units ((-)-alprenolol, (-)-pindolol, (-)-bupranolol, nadolol and carvedilol). In the other group the pK(B) difference was of 2.1 - 3.0 log units ((-)-atenolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol, sotalol, (-)-propranolol and (-)-timolol). The beta-blockers competed with (-)-[(125)I]-cyanopindolol for binding to ventricular beta(1)-adrenoceptors. The binding affinities correlated with the corresponding blocking potencies against (-)-isoprenaline. On average the pK(i) values were 0.5 log units smaller than the pK(B) values against (-)-isoprenaline but 1.6 log units greater than the pK(B) values against CGP12177. In ferret ventricle the effects of (-)-isoprenaline appear to be antagonized by beta-blockers through the state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor for which (-)-[(125)I]-cyanopindolol and beta-blockers have high affinity. The cardiostimulant effects of CGP12177 appear to be mediated through a low-affinity state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor for which beta-blockers have low affinity.

12605072|t|Alcoholism: allostasis and beyond.
12605072|a|Alcoholism is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by compulsive drinking, loss of control over intake, and impaired social and occupational function. Animal models have been developed for various stages of the alcohol addiction cycle with a focus on the motivational effects of withdrawal, craving, and protracted abstinence. A conceptual framework focused on allostatic changes in reward function that lead to excessive drinking provides a heuristic framework with which to identify the neurobiologic mechanisms involved in the development of alcoholism. Neuropharmacologic studies in animal models have provided evidence for specific neurochemical mechanisms in specific brain reward and stress circuits that become dysregulated during the development of alcohol dependence. The brain reward system implicated in the development of alcoholism comprises key elements of a basal forebrain macrostructure termed the extended amygdala that includes the central nucleus of the amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and a transition zone in the medial (shell) part of the nucleus accumbens. There are multiple neurotransmitter systems that converge on the extended amygdala that become dysregulated during the development of alcohol dependence, including gamma-aminobutyric acid, opioid peptides, glutamate, serotonin, and dopamine. In addition, the brain stress systems may contribute significantly to the allostatic state. During the development of alcohol dependence, corticotropin-releasing factor may be recruited, and the neuropeptide Y brain antistress system may be compromised. These changes in the reward and stress systems are hypothesized to maintain hedonic stability in an allostatic state, as opposed to a homeostatic state, and as such convey the vulnerability for relapse in recovering alcoholics. The allostatic model not only integrates molecular, cellular, and circuitry neuroadaptations in brain motivational systems produced by chronic alcohol ingestion with genetic vulnerability but also provides a key to translate advances in animal studies to the human condition.

20089134|t|Parkin regulates metal transport via proteasomal degradation of the 1B isoforms of divalent metal transporter 1.
20089134|a|Abnormal iron accumulation is linked to a variety of neurological disorders and may contribute to the progressive damage seen in these diseases. The biochemical processes responsible for iron accumulation are not known but are likely to entail alteration in transport into injured brain areas. The major transport protein responsible for uptake of iron is divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and recent studies demonstrate that the 1B species is regulated post-translationally by degradation via the proteasomal pathway. As reported in this paper, the E3 ligase, parkin, when over-expressed in SH-SY5Y cells, results in a decrease in 1B-DMT1 isoforms and also a significant reduction in manganese transport and toxicity. Incubating cells over-expressing parkin with the proteasomal inhibitor, MG-132, restores 1B-DMT1 levels emphasizing that the observed changes are caused by degradation via the proteasomal pathway. Expression of the 1B species of DMT1 was also shown to be elevated in human lymphocytes containing a homozygous deletion of exon 4 of parkin and in brains of parkin knockout animals. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent studies confirm that parkin co-localizes with DMT1 in SH-SY5Y cells transfected with wild-type parkin. These results demonstrate that parkin is the E3 ligase responsible for ubiquitination of the 1B species of DMT1.

12676886|t|The cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) is the main catalyst of efavirenz primary and secondary metabolism: implication for HIV/AIDS therapy and utility of efavirenz as a substrate marker of CYP2B6 catalytic activity.
12676886|a|We used human liver microsomes (HLMs) and recombinant cytochromes P450 (P450s) to identify the routes of efavirenz metabolism and the P450s involved. In HLMs, efavirenz undergoes primary oxidative hydroxylation to 8-hydroxyefavirenz (major) and 7-hydroxyefavirenz (minor) and secondary metabolism to 8,14-dihydroxyefavirenz. The formation of 8-hydroxyefavirenz in two HLMs showed sigmoidal kinetics (average apparent Km, 20.2 micro M; Vmax, 140 pmol/min/mg protein; and Hill coefficient, 1.5), whereas that of 7-hydroxyefavirenz formation was characterized by hyperbolic kinetics (Km, 40.1 micro M and Vmax, 20.5 pmol/min/mg protein). In a panel of 10 P450s, CYP2B6 formed 8-hydroxyefavirenz and 8,14-dihydroxyefavirenz from efavirenz (10 micro M) at the highest rate. The Km value for the formation of 8-hydroxyefavirenz in CYP2B6 derived from hyperbolic Eq. 12.4 micro M) was close to that obtained in HLMs (Km, 20.2 micro M). None of the P450s tested showed activity toward 7-hydroxylation of efavirenz. When 8-hydroxyefavirenz (2.5 micro M) was used as a substrate, 8,14-dihydroxyefavirenz was formed by CYP2B6 at the highest rate, and its kinetics showed substrate inhibition (Ksi, approximately 94 micro M in HLMs and approximately 234 micro M in CYP2B6). In a panel of 11 HLMs, 8-hydroxyefavirenz and 8,14-dihydroxyefavirenz formation rates from efavirenz (10 micro M) correlated significantly with the activity of CYP2B6 and CYP3A. N,N',N"-Triethylenethiophosphoramide (thioTEPA; 50 micro M) inhibited the formation rates of 8-hydroxyefavirenz and 8,14-dihydroxyefavirenz from efavirenz (10 micro M) by > or = 60% in HLMs) and CYP2B6, with Ki values < 4 micro M. In conclusion, CYP2B6 is the principal catalyst of efavirenz sequential hydroxylation. Efavirenz systemic exposure is likely to be subject to interindividual variability in CYP2B6 activity and to drug interactions involving this isoform. Efavirenz may be a valuable phenotyping tool to study the role of CYP2B6 in human drug metabolism.

10660562|t|Cloning and functional identification of a neuronal glutamine transporter.
10660562|a|Glutamine is the preferred precursor for the neurotransmitter pool of glutamate, the major excitatory transmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. We have isolated a complementary DNA clone (designated GlnT) encoding a plasma membrane glutamine transporter from glutamatergic neurons in culture, and its properties have been examined using the T7 vaccinia system in fibroblasts. When GlnT is transfected into CV-1 cells, L-glutamine is the preferred substrate. Transport is Na(+)-dependent and inhibited by alpha-methylaminoisobutyric acid, a specific inhibitor of neutral amino acid transport system A. Kinetic analysis of glutamine uptake by GlnT is saturable, with a Michaelis constant (K(m)) of 489 +/- 88 microM at pH 7.4. Glutamine uptake mediated by GlnT is pH-sensitive with a 5-fold greater efficiency of uptake at pH 8.2 than at pH 6.6. Only the maximal velocity of transport increases without a significant change in K(m). The distribution of GlnT mRNA and protein in the central nervous system is widespread and is expressed on neurons that use glutamate as their neurotransmitter. In cultured cerebellar granule cells, GlnT is expressed only on neurons and is absent from astrocytes. GlnT expression increases concomitantly with the morphologic and functional differentiation of these cells in vitro, consistent with its role of supplying glutamatergic neurons with their neurotransmitter precursor. GlnT is the first member of the system A family of neutral amino acid transporters with 11 putative membrane-spanning domains and is a potential target to modulate presynaptic glutamatergic function.

10847627|t|Molecular regulation of the human inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene.
10847627|a|In critically ill patients, the human inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene is expressed in nearly every organ and has been shown to be associated with the refractory hypotension of septic and hemorrhagic shock. The molecular regulation of iNOS expression is complex and occurs at multiple sites in the gene expression pathway. Work in our laboratory has demonstrated that a combination of cytokines synergistically activate iNOS expression, which has resulted in the cloning of the first human iNOS gene from cytokine-stimulated hepatocytes. In addition, we have demonstrated that iNOS expression is transcriptionally regulated and that the functional promoter elements are located upstream of -4.7 kilobases (kb) within a unique enhancer region containing four functional nuclear factor kappa B elements. These results contrast markedly with the murine iNOS promoter, where only 1.0 kb of 5'-flanking sequence is required for lipopolysaccharide and cytokine responsiveness. Furthermore, numerous mechanisms have evolved to down-regulate iNOS expression. By elucidating these mechanisms, therapeutic strategies to govern iNOS expression may be developed.

19584937|t|Identification of novel reference genes using multiplatform expression data and their validation for quantitative gene expression analysis.
19584937|a|Normalization of mRNA levels using endogenous reference genes (ERGs) is critical for an accurate comparison of gene expression between different samples. Despite the popularity of traditional ERGs (tERGs) such as GAPDH and ACTB, their expression variability in different tissues or disease status has been reported. Here, we first selected candidate housekeeping genes (HKGs) using human gene expression data from different platforms including EST, SAGE, and microarray, and 13 novel ERGs (nERGs) (ARL8B, CTBP1, CUL1, DIMT1L, FBXW2, GPBP1, LUC7L2, OAZ1, PAPOLA, SPG21, TRIM27, UBQLN1, ZNF207) were further identified from these HKGs. The mean coefficient variation (CV) values of nERGs were significantly lower than those of tERGs and the expression level of most nERGs was relatively lower than high expressing tERGs in all dataset. The higher expression stability and lower expression levels of most nERGs were validated in 108 human samples including formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, frozen tissues and cell lines, through quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, the optimal number of nERGs required for accurate normalization was as few as two, while four genes were required when using tERGs in FFPE tissues. Most nERGs identified in this study should be better reference genes than tERGs, based on their higher expression stability and fewer numbers needed for normalization when multiple ERGs are required.

11376933|t|Molecular biological approaches to unravel adenylyl cyclase signaling and function.
11376933|a|Signal transduction through the cell membrane requires the participation of one or more plasma membrane proteins. For many transmembrane signaling events adenylyl cyclases (ACs) are the final effector enzymes which integrate and interpret divergent signals from different pathways. The enzymatic activity of adenylyl cyclases is stimulated or inhibited in response to the activation of a large number of receptors in virtually all cells of the human body. To date, ten different mammalian isoforms of adenylyl cyclase (AC) have been cloned and characterized. Each isoform has its own distinct tissue distribution and regulatory properties, providing possibilities for different cells to respond diversely to similar stimuli. The product of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by ACs, cyclic AMP (cAMP) has been shown to play a crucial role for a variety of fundamental physiological cell functions ranging from cell growth and differentiation, to transcriptional regulation and apoptosis. In the past, investigations into the regulatory mechanisms of ACs were limited by difficulties associated with their purification and the availability of the proteins in any significant amount. Moreover, nearly every cell expresses several AC isoforms. Therefore, it was difficult to perform biochemical characterization of the different AC isoforms and nearly impossible to assess the physiological roles of the individual isoforms in intact cells, tissue or organisms. Recently, however, different molecular biological approaches have permitted several breakthroughs in the study of ACs. Recombinant technologies have allowed biochemical analysis of adenylyl cyclases in-vitro and the development of transgenic animals as well as knock-out mice have yielded new insights in the physiological role of some AC isoforms. In this review, we will focus mainly on the most novel approaches and concepts, which have delineated the mechanisms regulating AC and unravelled novel functions for this enzyme.

1443104|t|Erythrocyte K-Cl cotransport: properties and regulation.
1443104|a|Erythrocytes possess a Cl-dependent, Na-independent K transport system cotransporting K and Cl in a 1:1 stoichiometry that is membrane potential independent. This K-Cl cotransporter is stimulated by cell swelling, acidification, Mg depletion, and thiol modification. Cell shrinkage, elevation of cellular divalent ions, thiol alkylation, phosphatase inhibitors, and derivatives of certain loop diuretics and stilbenes are inhibitory. Thus regulation of K-Cl cotransport at the membrane and cytoplasmic levels is highly complex. Basal K-Cl cotransport decreases with cellular maturation, whereas its modes of stimulation and inhibition are variable between species. The physiological inactivation appears to be prevented in low-K animal erythrocytes. In certain human hemoglobinopathies, K-Cl cotransport may be the cause of cellular dehydration and volume decrease. K-Cl cotransport occurs also in nonerythroid cells, such as in epithelial and liver cells of other species. At the threshold of molecular characterization, this comprehensive review places our present understanding of the mechanisms modulating K-Cl cotransport physiologically and pathophysiologically into kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives.

14990356|t|Resveratrol protects myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury through both NO-dependent and NO-independent mechanisms.
14990356|a|We previously showed that resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene) stimulates NO production and is cardioprotective in rat heart subjected to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R rat heart). We now show that in I/R rat heart, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression is markedly induced, while expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and nueronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is unchanged. In animals preconditioned with resveratrol (0.5 to 1 mg/kg body wt), I/R-induced iNOS induction is abrogated; however, expression of eNOS and nNOS is greatly upregulated. The protective effects of resveratrol on I/R rat heart include reduced rhythm disturbances, reduced cardiac infarct size, and decreased plasma levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK). Among these, the reductions in LDH/CK levels and infarct size are NO-dependent as the coadministration of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 1 mg/kg body wt) with resveratrol abolishes the resveratrol effect. In contrast, the reductions in the severity of ventricular arrhythmia and mortality rate are not affected by L-NAME coadministration, suggesting that a NO-independent mechanism is involved.

8189746|t|JPCalc, a software package for calculating liquid junction potential corrections in patch-clamp, intracellular, epithelial and bilayer measurements and for correcting junction potential measurements.
8189746|a|The JPCalc program has been designed to graphically illustrate how junction potential contributions arise in various electrophysiological situations, to enable the magnitude and direction of those values to be readily calculated and to show clearly how the resultant appropriate corrections need to be applied to experimental measurements. In particular, the program covers the analysis of junction potential contributions and corrections in all the various different patch-clamp configurations (intact patches, inside-out patches, outside-out patches, whole-cell recording and perforated patches), intracellular recording, epithelial and bilayer measurements. It can also be used to correct experimental measurements designed to try to directly measure junction potentials and to compare both the magnitude and direction of such corrected measurements with their theoretical values. Although it is recommended that all of the above measurements be done with salt-filled electrodes or salt bridges, the program will allow the use of Ag/AgCl reference electrodes in direct contact with bathing solution in most situations. JPCalc also makes use of a library file of mobility and valency data for about 30 ions which can be extended by the user. In addition to its value in correcting electrical measurements, the program with its graphical displays may also be of value in focusing discussion about the contribution of junction potentials to such measurements and in helping to design experiments to either minimize their contribution or to measure their values. The JPCalc program, designed for IBM-compatible computers with color or monochrome monitors, can also be run on Macintosh computers with SoftPC emulation software.

21228185|t|HDAC3 is a critical negative regulator of long-term memory formation.
21228185|a|Gene expression is dynamically regulated by chromatin modifications on histone tails, such as acetylation. In general, histone acetylation promotes transcription, whereas histone deacetylation negatively regulates transcription. The interplay between histone acetyltranserases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) is pivotal for the regulation of gene expression required for long-term memory processes. Currently, very little is known about the role of individual HDACs in learning and memory. We examined the role of HDAC3 in long-term memory using a combined genetic and pharmacologic approach. We used HDAC3-FLOX genetically modified mice in combination with adeno-associated virus-expressing Cre recombinase to generate focal homozygous deletions of Hdac3 in area CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus. To complement this approach, we also used a selective inhibitor of HDAC3, RGFP136 [N-(6-(2-amino-4-fluorophenylamino)-6-oxohexyl)-4-methylbenzamide]. Immunohistochemistry showed that focal deletion or intrahippocampal delivery of RGFP136 resulted in increased histone acetylation. Both the focal deletion of HDAC3 as well as HDAC3 inhibition via RGFP136 significantly enhanced long-term memory in a persistent manner. Next we examined expression of genes implicated in long-term memory from dorsal hippocampal punches using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A, member 2 (Nr4a2) and c-fos was significantly increased in the hippocampus of HDAC3-FLOX mice compared with wild-type controls. Memory enhancements observed in HDAC3-FLOX mice were abolished by intrahippocampal delivery of Nr4a2 small interfering RNA, suggesting a mechanism by which HDAC3 negatively regulates memory formation. Together, these findings demonstrate a critical role for HDAC3 in the molecular mechanisms underlying long-term memory formation.

19409267|t|Interplay between cytosolic dopamine, calcium, and alpha-synuclein causes selective death of substantia nigra neurons.
19409267|a|The basis for selective death of specific neuronal populations in neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a synucleinopathy characterized by a preferential loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), whereas neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are spared. Using intracellular patch electrochemistry to directly measure cytosolic dopamine (DA(cyt)) in cultured midbrain neurons, we confirm that elevated DA(cyt) and its metabolites are neurotoxic and that genetic and pharmacological interventions that decrease DA(cyt) provide neuroprotection. L-DOPA increased DA(cyt) in SN neurons to levels 2- to 3-fold higher than in VTA neurons, a response dependent on dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels, resulting in greater susceptibility of SN neurons to L-DOPA-induced neurotoxicity. DA(cyt) was not altered by alpha-synuclein deletion, although dopaminergic neurons lacking alpha-synuclein were resistant to L-DOPA-induced cell death. Thus, an interaction between Ca2+, DA(cyt), and alpha-synuclein may underlie the susceptibility of SN neurons in PD, suggesting multiple therapeutic targets.

8739908|t|Serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin is a marker of the risk of hip fracture: a three year follow-up study.
8739908|a|We have previously shown that elderly women with an increased serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) level have an increased risk of sustaining a hip fracture as compared to those with normal serum ucOC. We reassessed our findings on a larger number of hip fractures that occurred over 3 years in 183 institutionalized women (aged 70-97 years) belonging to a large prospective clinical trial. Total OC, carboxylated OC, ucOC, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher at baseline in those who sustained a hip fracture during the follow-up. The age-adjusted odds ratio for hip fracture was three times higher in women with increased ucOC at baseline (odds ratio = 3.1, 99.9% C.I. = 1.7-6.0, p < 0.001). In the logistic regression, ucOC was still predictive of the hip fracture when age and parathyroid hormone concentration were included into the model (odds ratio = 2.6, 95% C.I. = 1.05-6.4). These data confirm that ucOC is a marker of the increased risk of hip fracture in elderly institutionalized women.

9661074|t|Mice lacking osteopontin show normal development and bone structure but display altered osteoclast formation in vitro.
9661074|a|We have used homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to generate mice with a targeted disruption of the osteopontin (Opn, or Spp1, for secreted phosphoprotein 1) gene. Mice homozygous for this disruption fail to express osteopontin (OPN) as assessed at both the mRNA and protein level, although an N-terminal fragment of OPN is detectable at extremely low levels in the bones of -/- animals. The Opn -/- mice are fertile, their litter size is normal, and they develop normally. The bones and teeth of animals not expressing OPN are morphologically normal at the level of light and electron microscopy, and the skeletal structure of young animals is normal as assessed by radiography. Ultrastructurally, proteinaceous structures normally rich in OPN, such as cement lines, persist in the bones of the Opn-/- animals. Osteoclastogenesis was assessed in vitro in cocultures with a feeder layer of calvarial osteoblast cells from wild-type mice. Spleen cells from Opn-/- mice cells formed osteoclasts 3- to 13-fold more frequently than did control Opn+/+ cells, while the extent of osteoclast development from Opn -/- bone marrow cells was about 2- to 4-fold more than from the corresponding wild-type cells. Osteoclast development occurred when Opn-/- spleen cells were differentiated in the presence of Opn-/-osteoblasts, indicating that endogenous OPN is not required for this process. These results suggest that OPN is not essential for normal mouse development and osteogenesis, but can modulate osteoclast differentiation.

11857487|t|The role of tumour-associated macrophages in tumour progression: implications for new anticancer therapies.
11857487|a|The role of macrophages in tumour growth and development is complex and multifaceted. Whilst there is limited evidence that tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) can be directly tumouricidal and stimulate the anti-tumour activity of T cells, there is now contrasting evidence that tumour cells are able to block or evade the activity of TAMs at the tumour site. In some cases, tumour-derived molecules even redirect TAM activities to promote tumour survival and growth. Indeed, evidence has emerged for a symbiotic relationship between tumour cells and TAMs, in which tumour cells attract TAMs and sustain their survival, with TAMs then responding to micro-environmental factors in tumours such as hypoxia (low oxygen tension) by producing important mitogens as well as various growth factors and enzymes that stimulate tumour angiogenesis. This review presents evidence for the number and/or distribution of TAMs being linked to prognosis in different types of human malignancy. It also outlines the range of pro- and anti-tumour functions performed by TAMs, and the novel therapies recently devised using TAMs to stimulate host immune responses or deliver therapeutic gene constructs to solid tumours.

14566334|t|An animal model of age-related macular degeneration in senescent Ccl-2- or Ccr-2-deficient mice.
14566334|a|The study and treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness, has been hampered by a lack of animal models. Here we report that mice deficient either in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (Ccl-2; also known as MCP-1) or its cognate C-C chemokine receptor-2 (Ccr-2) develop cardinal features of AMD, including accumulation of lipofuscin in and drusen beneath the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), photoreceptor atrophy and choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Complement and IgG deposition in RPE and choroid accompanies senescence in this model, as in human AMD. RPE or choroidal endothelial production of Ccl-2 induced by complement C5a and IgG may mediate choroidal macrophage infiltration into aged wild-type choroids. Wild-type choroidal macrophages degrade C5 and IgG in eye sections of Ccl2(-/-) or Ccr2(-/-) mice. Impaired macrophage recruitment may allow accumulation of C5a and IgG, which induces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by RPE, possibly mediating development of CNV. These models implicate macrophage dysfunction in AMD pathogenesis and may be useful as a platform for validating therapies.

9618466|t|Structural homologies with ATP- and folate-binding enzymes in the crystal structure of folylpolyglutamate synthetase.
9618466|a|Folylpolyglutamate synthetase, which is responsible for the addition of a polyglutamate tail to folate and folate derivatives, is an ATP-dependent enzyme isolated from eukaryotic and bacterial sources, where it plays a key role in the retention of the intracellular folate pool. Here, we report the 2.4-A resolution crystal structure of the MgATP complex of the enzyme from Lactobacillus casei. The structural analysis reveals that folylpolyglutamate synthetase is a modular protein consisting of two domains, one with a typical mononucleotide-binding fold and the other strikingly similar to the folate-binding enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. We have located the active site of the enzyme in a large interdomain cleft adjacent to an ATP-binding P-loop motif. Opposite this site, in the C domain, a cavity likely to be the folate binding site has been identified, and inspection of this cavity and the surrounding protein structure suggests that the glutamate tail of the substrate may project into the active site. A further feature of the structure is a well defined Omega loop, which contributes both to the active site and to interdomain interactions. The determination of the structure of this enzyme represents the first step toward the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of polyglutamylation of folates and antifolates.

9618465|t|Cloning and characterization of human protease-activated receptor 4.
9618465|a|Protease-activated receptors 1-3 (PAR1, PAR2, and PAR3) are members of a unique G protein-coupled receptor family. They are characterized by a tethered peptide ligand at the extracellular amino terminus that is generated by minor proteolysis. A partial cDNA sequence of a fourth member of this family (PAR4) was identified in an expressed sequence tag database, and the full-length cDNA clone has been isolated from a lymphoma Daudi cell cDNA library. The ORF codes for a seven transmembrane domain protein of 385 amino acids with 33% amino acid sequence identity with PAR1, PAR2, and PAR3. A putative protease cleavage site (Arg-47/Gly-48) was identified within the extracellular amino terminus. COS cells transiently transfected with PAR4 resulted in the formation of intracellular inositol triphosphate when treated with either thrombin or trypsin. A PAR4 mutant in which the Arg-47 was replaced with Ala did not respond to thrombin or trypsin. A hexapeptide (GYPGQV) representing the newly exposed tethered ligand from the amino terminus of PAR4 after proteolysis by thrombin activated COS cells transfected with either wild-type or the mutant PAR4. Northern blot showed that PAR4 mRNA was expressed in a number of human tissues, with high levels being present in lung, pancreas, thyroid, testis, and small intestine. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, the human PAR4 gene was mapped to chromosome 19p12.

17074365|t|Functional and morphological study of cultured pancreatic islets treated with cyclosporine.
17074365|a|Cyclosporine A (CsA), a potent immunosuppressive drug, has been found to induce glucose intolerance through its toxic effect on the endocrine pancreas. It is not exactly known whether CsA has a direct effect on the endocrine pancreas or induces its effect indirectly. The present study was therefore undertaken to examine the function and morphology of isolated pancreatic islets when they are directly exposed in vitro to CsA. Pancreatic islets were isolated from adult male Lewis rats using collagenase ductal perfusion technique. The islets were separated with the discontinuous Ficoll gradient technique and further purified by hand picking of the non-islet tissue. The islets were cultured in RPMI-1640, pH 7.4 and maintained at 37 degrees C in a humid atmosphere of 5% (v/v) carbon dioxide in air. Cyclosporine was added to the culture medium to give a final concentration of 1 microg/ml (therapeutic dose), 5 microg/ml (toxic dose), or vehicle (control). Islets were harvested at 1, 4 and 10 days of culture and processed for functional or histological study. The functional study of the islets cultured with 1 microg/ml CsA showed insulin and C-peptide contents similar to those of the control islets. The islets cultured with 5 microg/ml CsA showed a marked decrease in insulin and C-peptide contents. Glucose-dependent insulin release was variable. C-peptide release was lower than that of the control following both the therapeutic and toxic doses of CsA. Phase contrast microscopy showed that the islets cultured with 1 microg/ml CsA were mostly normal looking with a well-defined regular periphery; a few islets had ill-defined or irregular peripheries. The islets cultured with 5 microg/ml CsA had ill-defined irregular peripheries at 1 day, and were dense and forming clumps at 4 and 10 days following culture. There was a decrease in the islet number following the therapeutic dose; the decrease was more following the toxic dose of CsA. The islet diameters increased after the therapeutic dose, but slightly decreased following the toxic dose of CsA. Islets showed a weakly positive immunoperoxidase reaction for insulin that was weaker following the toxic dose of CsA. It is concluded that CsA has a direct effect on B-cells that was proved by the functional and morphological changes seen in the pancreatic islets cultured in vitro.

2674117|t|Human liver serine dehydratase. cDNA cloning and sequence homology with hydroxyamino acid dehydratases from other sources.
2674117|a|Rat liver serine dehydratase cDNA was used to screen a human liver cDNA library in lambda gt11. One positive clone occurred in every 5,000 clones. Fifteen positive clones were plaque purified. The largest cDNA obtained contained an open reading frame of 987 base pairs, and 5' and 3' noncoding regions of 89 and 317 base pairs, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence, with a calculated Mr of 34,615, was similar to that of rat liver serine dehydratase except for the absence of a segment consisting of 36 amino acid residues. In vitro transcription/translation with the cDNA resulted in the formation of a polypeptide with an Mr of approximately 35,000, which cross-reacted with the anti-rat serine dehydratase antibody. These results suggest that the human serine dehydratase is structurally cognate with the rat enzyme. Moreover, portions of the sequence postulated to be essential for activity in microbial threonine dehydratases are found in the mammalian serine dehydratases, suggesting that hydroxyamino and dehydratases may have originated from a common ancestor.

7545891|a|During reperfusion of ischemic myocardium, there is a well-orchestrated interplay between the coronary vascular endothelium and the circulating neutrophils. This interplay involves the initial slowing or "rolling" of neutrophils along the endothelium during the early moments of reperfusion, followed by firm attachment and amplification of the neutrophil response, and culminating with the diapedesis of neutrophils into the myocardial parenchyma where neutrophil-myocyte interaction contributes to the necrotic process. The selectins are glycoproteins that play a key role in the early phases of neutrophil adherence and activation. There are three members of the selectin family: P-selectin on endothelial cells and platelets, L-selectin on neutrophils, and E-selectin on endothelium. Monoclonal antibodies directed specifically toward these selectins and their associated ligands (eg, Sialyl Lewisx) not only substantiate their role in the dynamic process of neutrophil-mediated reperfusion injury but also offer a unique therapeutic opportunity to interfere with this cascade of inflammatory events.

20008099|t|Quantitation of cellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates.
20008099|a|Eukaryotic cells contain a delicate balance of minute amounts of the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), sufficient only for a few minutes of DNA replication. Both a deficiency and a surplus of a single dNTP may result in increased mutation rates, faulty DNA repair or mitochondrial DNA depletion. dNTPs are usually quantified by an enzymatic assay in which incorporation of radioactive dATP (or radioactive dTTP in the assay for dATP) into specific synthetic oligonucleotides by a DNA polymerase is proportional to the concentration of the unknown dNTP. We find that the commonly used Klenow DNA polymerase may substitute the corresponding ribonucleotide for the unknown dNTP leading in some instances to a large overestimation of dNTPs. We now describe assay conditions for each dNTP that avoid ribonucleotide incorporation. For the dTTP and dATP assays it suffices to minimize the concentrations of the Klenow enzyme and of labeled dATP (or dTTP); for dCTP and dGTP we had to replace the Klenow enzyme with either the Taq DNA polymerase or Thermo Sequenase. We suggest that in some earlier reports ribonucleotide incorporation may have caused too high values for dGTP and dCTP.

10455434|t|Hydrodynamics-based transfection in animals by systemic administration of plasmid DNA.
10455434|a|Development of methods that allow an efficient expression of exogenous genes in animals would provide tools for gene function studies, treatment of diseases and for obtaining gene products. Therefore, we have developed a hydrodynamics-based procedure for expressing transgenes in mice by systemic administration of plasmid DNA. Using cDNA of luciferase and beta-galactosidase as a reporter gene, we demonstrated that an efficient gene transfer and expression can be achieved by a rapid injection of a large volume of DNA solution into animals via the tail vein. Among the organs expressing the transgene, the liver showed the highest level of gene expression. As high as 45 microg of luciferase protein per gram of liver can be achi- eved by a single tail vein injection of 5 microg of plasmid DNA into a mouse. Histochemical analysis using beta-galactosidase gene as a reporter reveals that approximately 40percent of hepatocytes express the transgene. The time-response curve shows that the level of transgene expression in the liver reaches the peak level in approximately 8 h after injection and decreases thereafter. The peak level of gene expression can be regained by repeated injection of plasmid DNA. These results suggest that a simple, convenient and efficient method has been developed and which can be used as an effective means for studying gene function, gene regulation and molecular pathophysiology through gene transfer, as well as for expressing proteins in animals.

20859780|t|An improved double-tuned and isotope-filtered pulse scheme based on a pulsed field gradient and a wide-band inversion shaped pulse.
20859780|a|We have developed an improved isotope-filtered pulse scheme in combination with a double-tuned filter, a hyperbolic secant inversion pulse, and a z-filter with a pulsed field gradient. These filtering pulse schemes have been incorporated into several one-, two-, and three-dimensional experiments, which were applied to the (13)C/(15)N uniformly labeled N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 complexed with the unlabeled Sos-derived peptide. The proton resonances of the Sos-derived peptide were unambiguously assigned using isotope-filtered DQF-COSY, TOCSY and NOESY spectra. Furthermore, in the isotope-filtered, isotope-edited 3D NOESY spectrum, intermolecular NOEs between the labeled protein and the unlabeled peptide could be identified. Through these applications, we demonstrate the high filtering efficiency of the presented pulse scheme.

8621617|t|Mitochondria are a major site for folate and thymidylate synthesis in plants.
8621617|a|The subcellular distributions of folate and folate-synthesizing enzymes were investigated in pea leaves. It was observed that the mitochondrial folate pool (approximately 400 micron) represented approximately 50% of the total pool. Furthermore, all the enzymes involved in tetrahydrofolate polyglutamate synthesis were present in the mitochondria. In marked contrast, we failed to detect any significant activity of these enzymes in chloroplasts, cytosol, and nuclei. The presence of the tetrahydrofolate synthesis pathway in mitochondria is apparently a general feature in plants since potato tuber mitochondria also contained a high folate concentration (approximately 200 micron) and all the enzymes required for tetrahydrofolate polyglutamate synthesis. The specific activities of tetrahydrofolate-synthesizing enzymes were rather low (1.5-15 nmol h-1 mg-1 matrix protein), except for dihydrofolate reductase (180-500 nmol h-1 mg-1 matrix protein). Dihydrofolate reductase was purified to homogeneity. The enzyme had a native molecular mass of approximately 140 kDa and was constituted of two identical 62-kDa subunits. Interestingly, this mitochondrial protein appeared to be a bifunctional enzyme, also supporting thymidylate synthesis. The cell distribution of thymidylate synthase was also investigated. No significant activity was observed in cell fractions other than mitochondria, indicating that plant cell mitochondria are also a major site for thymidylate synthesis.

3255805|t|Evidence for reduced Cl- and increased Na+ permeability in cystic fibrosis human primary cell cultures.
3255805|a|1. Employing a primary cell culture system and intracellular microelectrodes, we quantitated and compared the Na+ and Cl- pathways in apical membranes of normal and cystic fibrosis (CF) human airway epithelia. 2. Like the transepithelial difference (PD) in situ, the PD of CF epithelia in culture (-27 +/- 4 mV, mean +/- S.E.M.; n = 28) exceeded the PD of normal epithelia (-10 +/- 1 mV; n = 22). The raised PD principally reflected an increase in the rate of active transport (equivalent short circuit, Ieq) for CF epithelia (61 +/- 9 microA cm-2) as compared with normal epithelia (23 +/- 3 microA cm-2). No significant differences in transepithelial resistance were detected. 3. As indicated by ion replacement studies (gluconate for Cl-), the apical membrane of normal cells exhibits an apical membrane Cl- conductance (GCl) that can be activated by isoprenaline. CF cells do not exhibit an apical membrane GCl, nor can a GCl be activated by isoprenaline. 4. CF cells exhibited a larger amiloride-sensitive Ieq and amiloride-sensitive apical membrane conductance (GNa) than normal cells. Further, the amiloride-sensitive Ieq was increased by isoprenaline in CF but not normal airway epithelia. 5. Equivalent circuit analysis yielded evidence for a more positive electromotive force (EMF) across the apical membrane and a more negative EMF across the basolateral membrane of CF cells as compared with normal cells. Baseline resistances of the apical (Ra) and basolateral (Rb) membranes did not differ for normal and CF cells. 6. Estimates of the resistance of the paracellular path to ion flow (Rs) by equivalent circuit analysis or ion substitution detected no differences in Rs between CF and normal cells. 7. We conclude that abnormalities in both cellular Cl- permeability (reduced) and Na+ permeability (increased) are characteristic of the cultured CF respiratory epithelial cell. These data suggest that a defect in the regulation of apical membrane permeabilities is a central feature of this disease.

3923523|t|The tail suspension test: a new method for screening antidepressants in mice.
3923523|a|A novel test procedure for antidepressants was designed in which a mouse is suspended by the tail from a lever, the movements of the animal being recorded. The total duration of the test (6 min) can be divided into periods of agitation and immobility. Several psychotropic drugs were studied: amphetamine, amitriptyline, atropine, desipramine, mianserin, nomifensine and viloxazine. Antidepressant drugs decrease the duration of immobility, as do psychostimulants and atropine. If coupled with measurement of locomotor activity in different conditions, the test can separate the locomotor stimulant doses from antidepressant doses. Diazepam increases the duration of immobility. The main advantages of this procedure are the use of a simple, objective test situation, the concordance of the results with the validated "behavioral despair" test from Porsolt and the sensitivity to a wide range of drug doses.

11272779|t|Safety and efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone for cystoid macular oedema in uveitis.
11272779|a|PURPOSE: To report the safety and efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone in the treatment of inflammatory cystoid macular oedema (CMO) in six patients who were resistant to other forms of therapy. METHODS: An open-label unmasked prospective nonrandomized pilot study of six patients with idiopathic uveitis and visually significant macular oedema, resistant to periocular and/or systemic corticosteroid treatment, was carried out. Baseline examination and investigations were performed, including fundus fluorescein angiography, and the patients were given a single intravitreal injection of triamcinolone (4 mg/0.1 mL). The primary outcome measure was angiographic resolution of CMO. Patients were reviewed at intervals of 2-4 weeks for 12 months. RESULTS: A single intravitreal injection of triamcinolone induced clinical and angiographic resolution of inflammatory macular oedema in all patients for varying periods of time up to 6 months. Five patients experienced increased intraocular pressure to 30 mmHg or greater which required treatment. Two patients developed posterior subcapsular cataract. CONCLUSION: One injection of intravitreal triamcinolone was an effective short-term treatment for resistant CMO in uveitis. As with steroids given by other routes, raised intraocular pressure and cataract may occur. As it was so effective in these eyes with resistant CMO, a larger study is warranted to evaluate this form of therapy.

15870199|t|A common haplotype in the complement regulatory gene factor H (HF1/CFH) predisposes individuals to age-related macular degeneration.
15870199|a|Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most frequent cause of irreversible blindness in the elderly in developed countries. Our previous studies implicated activation of complement in the formation of drusen, the hallmark lesion of AMD. Here, we show that factor H (HF1), the major inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway, accumulates within drusen and is synthesized by the retinal pigmented epithelium. Because previous linkage analyses identified chromosome 1q25-32, which harbors the factor H gene (HF1/CFH), as an AMD susceptibility locus, we analyzed HF1 for genetic variation in two independent cohorts comprised of approximately 900 AMD cases and 400 matched controls. We found association of eight common HF1 SNPs with AMD; two common missense variants exhibit highly significant associations (I62V, chi2 = 26.1 and P = 3.2 x 10(-7) and Y402H, chi2 = 54.4 and P = 1.6 x 10(-13)). Haplotype analysis reveals that multiple HF1 variants confer elevated or reduced risk of AMD. One common at-risk haplotype is present at a frequency of 50% in AMD cases and 29% in controls [odds ratio (OR) = 2.46, 95% confidence interval (1.95-3.11)]. Homozygotes for this haplotype account for 24% of cases and 8% of controls [OR = 3.51, 95% confidence interval (2.13-5.78)]. Several protective haplotypes are also identified (OR = 0.44-0.55), further implicating HF1 function in the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying AMD. We propose that genetic variation in a regulator of the alternative complement pathway, when combined with a triggering event, such as infection, underlie a major proportion of AMD in the human population.

12789343|t|A nucleosomal function for IkappaB kinase-alpha in NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression.
12789343|a|NF-kappaB is a principal transcriptional regulator of diverse cytokine-mediated processes and is tightly controlled by the IkappaB kinase complex (IKK-alpha/beta/gamma). IKK-beta and IKK-gamma are critical for cytokine-induced NF-kappaB function, whereas IKK-alpha is thought to be involved in other regulatory pathways. However, recent data suggest a role for IKK-alpha in NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression in response to cytokine treatment. Here we demonstrate nuclear accumulation of IKK-alpha after cytokine exposure, suggesting a nuclear function for this protein. Consistent with this, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays reveal that IKK-alpha was recruited to the promoter regions of NF-kappaB-regulated genes on stimulation with tumour-necrosis factor-alpha. Notably, NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression is suppressed by the loss of IKK-alpha and this correlates with a complete loss of gene-specific phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10, a modification previously associated with positive gene expression. Furthermore, we show that IKK-alpha can directly phosphorylate histone H3 in vitro, suggesting a new substrate for this kinase. We propose that IKK-alpha is an essential regulator of NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression through control of promoter-associated histone phosphorylation after cytokine exposure.

2272629|t|Application of structural model of glucose-insulin relations to assess beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity.
2272629|a|A structural mathematical model of glucose-insulin relationships based on known quantitative responses of the major organs involved with glucose metabolism has been computed. Different degrees of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity can be included, and the effect of their interaction assessed (i) in a steady state, basal homeostasis after an overnight fast and (ii) in response to a glucose infusion. By comparing a patient's basal plasma glucose and insulin (or C-peptide) concentrations with the predictions of a basal homeostatic model, the degree of impairment of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity can be assessed. Similarly, the plasma glucose and insulin (or C-peptide) concentrations after a continuous glucose infusion can also be compared with predictions from the model to estimate beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity. These assessments of pathophysiology can be applied to data from individual patients or to patient populations.

3965932|t|Risk factors for breast cancer in women with proliferative breast disease.
3965932|a|To assess the importance of various risk factors for breast cancer in women with benign proliferative breast lesions, we reevaluated 10,366 consecutive breast biopsies performed in women who had presented at three Nashville hospitals. The median duration of follow-up was 17 years for 3303 women, 1925 of whom had proliferative disease. This sample contained 84.4 per cent of the patients originally selected for follow-up. Women having proliferative disease without atypical hyperplasia had a risk of cancer that was 1.9 times the risk in women with nonproliferative lesions (95 per cent confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.9). The risk in women with atypical hyperplasia (atypia) was 5.3 times that in women with nonproliferative lesions (95 per cent confidence interval, 3.1 to 8.8). A family history of breast cancer had little effect on the risk in women with nonproliferative lesions. However, the risk in women with atypia and a family history of breast cancer was 11 times that in women who had nonproliferative lesions without a family history (95 per cent confidence interval, 5.5 to 24). Calcification elevated the cancer risk in patients with proliferative disease. Although cysts alone did not substantially elevate the risk, women with both cysts and a family history of breast cancer had a risk 2.7 times higher than that for women without either of these risk factors (95 per cent confidence interval, 1.5 to 4.6). This study demonstrates that the majority of women (70 per cent) who undergo breast biopsy for benign disease are not at increased risk of cancer. However, patients with a clinically meaningful elevation in cancer risk can be identified on the basis of atypical hyperplasia and a family history of breast cancer.

12859420|t|Cardiovascular status following combined angiotensin-converting enzyme and AT1 receptor inhibition in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats.
12859420|a|1. Combined treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with AT1 receptor antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been shown to reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) more than monotherapy with either agent. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of chronic dual renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition using non-hypotensive doses of the AT1 receptor antagonist candesartan cilexetil and the ACE inhibitor perindopril on cardiovascular function and structure. 2. Adult male SHR, aged 15 weeks, were divided into four groups: (i) candesartan cilexetil (0.5 mg/kg per day in drinking water); (ii) perindopril (0.3 mg/kg per day in drinking water); (iii) combined treatment (dual RAS inhibition); or (iv) the appropriate vehicle (0.1% ethanol/0.1% polyethylene glycol/1.5 mmol/l sodium bicarbonate dissolved in water for candesartan cilexetil; distilled water for perindopril). Systolic blood pressure was measured weekly using the tail-cuff method and urinary microalbuminuria was measured fortnightly. 3. After 4 weeks, rats were instrumented for intravenous drug administration and measurement of MAP. At this time, the cardiovascular effects of angiotensin (Ang) I and AngII (5-20 ng) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and acetylcholine (ACh; 1-5 micro g) were assessed. In addition, left ventricular : bodyweight and media : lumen ratios were determined as indices of cardiac and vascular hypertrophy, respectively. 4. Candesartan cilexetil and perindopril alone had minimal effect on MAP when measured both directly and indirectly, whereas direct MAP was significantly decreased in the combined treatment group (131 +/- 6 mmHg; P < 0.05) compared with the vehicle group (156 +/- 9 mmHg). Pressor responses to AngI were significantly decreased in all groups compared with the vehicle-treated group and pressor responses to AngII were significantly decreased in the candesartan cilexetil-treated (P < 0.01) and combined treatment groups (P < 0.01) compared with the vehicle-treated group. Depressor responses to ACh and SNP were not significantly affected by any of the antihypertensive therapies compared with vehicle-treated SHR. 5. Vascular hypertrophy was significantly decreased in the candesartan cilexetil and combined groups compared with the vehicle-treated group, whereas cardiac hypertrophy was reduced, with the rank order of effect being: dual RAS inhibition > perindopril > candesartan cilexetil. Urinary albumin tended to decrease with dual RAS inhibition, but was not significantly affected by this short-term treatment. 6. These results demonstrate the efficacy of low-dose dual RAS inhibition as an antihypertensive modality, at least in SHR, not only in reducing arterial pressure, but also in improving cardiovascular structure.

7579089|t|Atrial natriuretic peptide stimulates the expression of transforming growth factor-beta in cultured murine mesangial cells: relationship to suppression of proliferation.
7579089|a|Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a growth suppressor for a variety of different cell types including cultured mesangial cells. This study examined the effects of ANP on the expression and synthesis of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in a cultured murine mesangial cell line (MMC). Full-length rat ANP as well as 8-bromo-cGMP, but not ring-deleted ANP analogues, induced, in a dose-dependent manner, TGF-beta 1 mRNA expression in MMC. Moreover, full-length ANP and 8-bromo-cGMP stimulated the synthesis and release of TGF-beta 1 into cell culture supernatants as measured by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and mink cell bioassay. The induction of TGF-beta 1 by 10(-6) M ANP and 10(-4) M 8-bromo-cGMP for 24 h was also documented by western blotting of MMC culture supernatants. However, transient transfection studies in MMC with three different murine TGF-beta 1 reporter gene constructs revealed only little stimulation of activity after ANP treatment, suggesting that posttranscriptional activation may mainly contribute to TGF-beta mRNA induction. Functional studies demonstrated that the ANP-mediated inhibition of mitosis, induced by 5% fetal calf serum, is partly abolished in the presence of a neutralizing anti-TGF-beta 1-3 antibody. In addition, the antiproliferative effects of exogenous 8-bromo-cGMP are also attenuated by anti-TGF-beta 1-3 antibody. These findings indicate that ANP stimulates TGF-beta expression in MMC and that the antiproliferative effects of ANP in this cell line may be mediated, at least to some extent, by the endogenous induction of TGF-beta. An increase in intracellular cGMP is most likely the mediator of this TGF-beta 1 induction. Considering the fibrogenic effects of TGF-beta, these findings may be important in the development of glomerulosclerosis in situations with an increase in local or systemic ANP.

561632|t|Activation of bovine factor VII by hageman factor fragments.
561632|a|During the early events of coagulation of human blood by the intrinsic pathway, factor XII is activated to a form which can activate factor XI, and is proteolytically fragmented to smaller species (30,000 daltons and 70,000 daltons) which have lost most of the ability to activate factor XI but which can activate prekallikrein rapidly. The effect of these fragments on factor VII was studied. It was found that these Hageman factor fragments promoted rapid proteolysis of one-chain factor VII to a more active two-chain form. The amino-terminal sequences of the chains of activated factor VII were found to be Ala-Asx-Gly- and Ile-Val-Gly-, the same as were earlier observed after activation of factor VII by activated factor X. This finding indicates that initiation of coagulation by the intrinsic pathway also primes the extrinsic pathway.

8959321|t|Glutathione S-transferase M1 genotypes and the risk of anal cancer: a population-based case-control study.
8959321|a|Some studies have reported an association of the GSTM1-null genotype with the risk of smoking-related cancers, such as lung, bladder, and colon cancer. Because the risk of anal cancer is strongly associated with a history of cigarette smoking, we examined whether the GSTM1-null genotype is a susceptibility marker for anal cancer. We obtained peripheral blood specimens from residents of western Washington who were diagnosed with squamous or transitional cell tumor of the anus between April 1991 and June 1994. Eligible for inclusion were persons 18-74 years of age, with either invasive or in situ lesions. Specimens were also obtained from controls identified via random-digit dialing of western Washington households. We determined GSTM1 genotypes of 71 cases and 360 controls by PCR using primer pair 5'-AACTCCCTGAAAAGCTAAAGC-3' and 5'-GTTGGGCTCAAATATACGGTGG-3'. The frequency of the GSTM1-null genotype in controls was approximately 57%; this differed little in relation to age, sex and smoking status. The incidence of anal cancer appeared to be reduced in persons with the GSTM1-null genotype; only 39.4% of cases had this genotype (age-adjusted odds ratio = 0.5, 95% confidence interval = 0.3-0.9). This inverse association was restricted to persons who had ever smoked cigarettes and was present in both women and men (and in the latter, in both those who had and did not have a male sexual partner). Our data strongly suggest that persons with the GSTM1-null genotype are not at increased risk of anal cancer, and may well be at a decreased risk.

9635733|t|A molecular dynamics study of the pores formed by Escherichia coli OmpF porin in a fully hydrated palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer.
9635733|a|In this paper we study the properties of pores formed by OmpF porin from Escherichia coli, based on a molecular dynamics simulation of the OmpF trimer, 318 palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine lipids, 27 Na+ ions, and 12,992 water molecules. After equilibration and a nanosecond production run, the OmpF trimer exhibits a C-alpha root mean square deviation from the crystal structure of 0.23 nm and a stable secondary structure. No evidence is found for large-scale motions of the L3 loop. We investigate the pore dimensions, conductance, and the properties of water inside the pore. This water forms a complicated pattern, even when averaged over 1 ns of simulation time. Around the pore constriction zone the water dipoles are highly structured in the plane of the membrane, oriented by the strong transversal electric field. In addition, there is a net orientation along the pore axis pointing from the extracellular to the intracellular side of the bilayer. The diffusion coefficients of water inside the pore are greatly reduced compared to bulk. We compare our results to results from model pores (Breed et al., 1996. Biophys. J. 70:1 643-1 661; Sansom et al. 1997. Biophys. J. 73:2404-241 5) and discuss implications for further theoretical work.

16598306|a|Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are phosphorylated and activated by Janus kinases (JAKs). Recently, several groups identified a recurrent somatic point mutation constitutively activating the hematopoietic growth factor receptor-associated JAK2 tyrosine kinase in diverse chronic myeloid disorders - most commonly classic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), especially polycythemia vera. We hypothesized that the JAK2 V617F mutation might also be present in samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially erythroleukemia (AML-M6) or megakaryoblastic leukemia (AML-M7), where it might mimic erythropoietin or thrombopoietin signaling. First, we documented STAT3 activation by immunoblotting in AML-M6 and other AML subtypes. Immunoperoxidase staining confirmed phosphorylated STAT3 in malignant myeloblasts (21% of cases, including all AML-M3 samples tested). We then analyzed genomic DNA from 162 AML, 30 B-cell lymphoma, and 10 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples for JAK2 mutations, and assayed a subset for SOCS1 and FLT3 mutations. Janus kinase2 V617F was present in 13/162 AML samples (8%): 10/13 transformed MPD, and three apparent de novo AML (one of 12 AML-M6, one of 24 AML-M7, and one AML-M2 - all mixed clonality). FLT3 mutations were present in 5/32 (16%), while SOCS1 mutations were totally absent. Lymphoproliferative disorder samples were both JAK2 and SOCS1 wild type. Thus, while JAK2 V617F is uncommon in de novo AML and probably does not occur in lymphoid malignancy, unexplained STAT3 activation is common in AML. Janus kinase2 extrinsic regulators and other proteins in the JAK-STAT pathway should be interrogated to explain frequent STAT activation in AML.

17699722|t|CCG-1423: a small-molecule inhibitor of RhoA transcriptional signaling.
17699722|a|Lysophosphatidic acid receptors stimulate a Galpha(12/13)/RhoA-dependent gene transcription program involving the serum response factor (SRF) and its coactivator and oncogene, megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1). Inhibitors of this pathway could serve as useful biological probes and potential cancer therapeutic agents. Through a transcription-based high-throughput serum response element-luciferase screening assay, we identified two small-molecule inhibitors of this pathway. Mechanistic studies on the more potent CCG-1423 show that it acts downstream of Rho because it blocks SRE.L-driven transcription stimulated by Galpha(12)Q231L, Galpha(13)Q226L, RhoA-G14V, and RhoC-G14V. The ability of CCG-1423 to block transcription activated by MKL1, but not that induced by SRF-VP16 or GAL4-VP16, suggests a mechanism targeting MKL/SRF-dependent transcriptional activation that does not involve alterations in DNA binding. Consistent with its role as a Rho/SRF pathway inhibitor, CCG-1423 displays activity in several in vitro cancer cell functional assays. CCG-1423 potently (<1 mumol/L) inhibits lysophosphatidic acid-induced DNA synthesis in PC-3 prostate cancer cells, and whereas it inhibits the growth of RhoC-overexpressing melanoma lines (A375M2 and SK-Mel-147) at nanomolar concentrations, it is less active on related lines (A375 and SK-Mel-28) that express lower levels of Rho. Similarly, CCG-1423 selectively stimulates apoptosis of the metastasis-prone, RhoC-overexpressing melanoma cell line (A375M2) compared with the parental cell line (A375). CCG-1423 inhibited Rho-dependent invasion by PC-3 prostate cancer cells, whereas it did not affect the Galpha(i)-dependent invasion by the SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cell line. Thus, based on its profile, CCG-1423 is a promising lead compound for the development of novel pharmacologic tools to disrupt transcriptional responses of the Rho pathway in cancer.

21556144|t|Region-specific expression of mitochondrial complex I genes during murine brain development.
21556144|a|Mutations in the nuclear encoded subunits of mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) may cause circumscribed cerebral lesions ranging from degeneration of the striatal and brainstem gray matter (Leigh syndrome) to leukodystrophy. We hypothesized that such pattern of regional pathology might be due to local differences in the dependence on complex I function. Using in situ hybridization we investigated the relative expression of 33 nuclear encoded complex I subunits in different brain regions of the mouse at E11.5, E17.5, P1, P11, P28 and adult (12 weeks). With respect to timing and relative intensity of complex I gene expression we found a highly variant pattern in different regions during development. High average expression levels were detected in periods of intense neurogenesis. In cerebellar Purkinje and in hippocampal CA1/CA3 pyramidal neurons we found a second even higher peak during the period of synaptogenesis and maturation. The extraordinary dependence of these structures on complex I gene expression during synaptogenesis is in accord with our recent findings that gamma oscillations--known to be associated with higher cognitive functions of the mammalian brain--strongly depend on the complex I activity. However, with the exception of the mesencephalon, we detected only average complex I expression levels in the striatum and basal ganglia, which does not explain the exquisite vulnerability of these structures in mitochondrial disorders.

21402544|t|Surge in expression of carboxylesterase 1 during the post-neonatal stage enables a rapid gain of the capacity to activate the anti-influenza prodrug oseltamivir.
21402544|a|BACKGROUND: Oseltamivir, a widely used anti-influenza drug, is hydrolytically activated by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). The expression of this carboxylesterase is developmentally regulated. This study was performed to determine when after birth infants acquire competence of activating this prodrug. METHODS: Liver tissue samples were collected and divided into 5 age groups: group 1 (1-31 d old), group 2 (35-70 d old), group 3 (89-119 d old), group 4 (123-198 d old), and group 5 (>18 years of age). These samples were analyzed for oseltamivir hydrolysis and CES1 expression. RESULTS: Liver samples in group 1 expressed the lowest level of CES1 with the lowest hydrolytic activity toward oseltamivir. A 4-7-fold increase between groups 1 and 2 (1-31 vs 35-70 d of age) was detected in the hydrolysis and expression analyses, respectively. Liver samples in the other 3 pediatric groups (35-198 d of age) exhibited similar expression and hydrolysis levels. Overall, liver samples in group 1 had CES1 expression and hydrolysis levels that were 10% of those of adults, whereas liver samples in the other 3 pediatric groups had levels that were    50% of adult levels. CONCLUSIONS: The post-neonatal surge in CES1 expression ensures the hydrolytic capacity to be gained rapidly after birth in infants, but the larger variability during this period suggests that caution should be exercised on the extrapolated dosing regimens of ester drugs from other age groups.

20014428|t|Species-specific interaction of HIV protease inhibitors with accumulation of cholyl-glycylamido-fluorescein (CGamF) in sandwich-cultured hepatocytes.
20014428|a|Using sandwich-cultured hepatocytes from rat, dog, pig, and human, we investigated the species-specificity of interaction of HIV protease inhibitors (PI) with in vitro hepatic accumulation of the bile salt analogue cholyl-glycylamido-fluorescein (CGamF). Extracellular sodium depletion or coincubation with the OATP/Oatp inhibitors rifampicin and digoxin revealed that about 35% of active CGamF accumulation was mediated by Ntcp/NTCP in rat and human hepatocytes, while the contribution of this sodium-dependent transporter reached 50-60% in dog and pig hepatocytes. One or more sodium-independent transporters, likely belonging to the Oatp/OATP family, constitute a major transport mechanism for CGamF accumulation. Various HIV PI (0.5, 5, 25 microM) exhibited pronounced species differences in their interaction with active CGamF accumulation (1 microM), although some similarity was observed between the dog and human interaction profiles when HIV PI were tested at 0.5 microM. Atazanavir, indinavir, and darunavir were the most potent inhibitors of CGamF accumulation in human hepatocytes. Potent inhibition of CGamF accumulation by ritonavir in rat hepatocytes contrasted with a weak effect in human hepatocytes. Thorough characterization of in vitro disposition of probe substrates in preclinical species compared to human hepatocytes will ultimately support a better insight in species-specific mechanisms underlying drug interactions and drug-mediated toxicity.

11781502|t|GABA(A)-receptor delta subunit knockout mice have multiple defects in behavioral responses to ethanol.
11781502|a|BACKGROUND: The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABARs) are involved in mediating some of the behavioral effects of beverage alcohol (ethanol). However, the unique pharmacological and behavioral responses conferred by each of the various receptor subunits are not well understood. METHODS: To address the role of the GABAR delta subunit in mediating ethanol responses, gene knockout mice that lack this subunit were tested for a variety of ethanol-induced behavioral responses. RESULTS: Our results indicate that, compared with controls, delta-deficient mice (delta-/-) have (1) reduced ethanol consumption, (2) attenuated withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure, and (3) reduced anticonvulsant (seizure-protective) effects of ethanol. These mice demonstrate a normal anxiolytic response to ethanol and a normal hypothermic response to ethanol, and they develop both chronic and acute tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: These results further establish the link between GABARs and specific behavioral responses to ethanol and begin to reveal the role of the delta subunit in these responses.

1860189|a|Prolongation of cardiac action potentials may mediate some of the arrhythmia-suppressing and arrhythmia-aggravating actions of antiarrhythmic agents. In this study, suppression of time-dependent outward current by quinidine and amiodarone was assessed in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. The net time-dependent outward current contained at least two components: a slowly activating, La(3+)-resistant delayed rectifier current (IK) and a rapidly activating, La(3+)-sensitive current. Quinidine block of total time-dependent outward current during clamp steps to positive potentials was relieved as a function of time, whereas that induced by amiodarone was enhanced. In contrast, at negative potentials, suppression of current, whereas amiodarone reduced IK but not the La(3+)-sensitive current, suggesting that differential block of the two components of time-dependent current underlies the distinct effects of the two agents. In contrast to these disparate effects on total time-dependent outward current, steady-state reduction of IK by both drugs increased at positive voltages and saturated at approximately +40 mV; the voltage dependence of block by quinidine (17% per decade, +10 to +30 mV) was steeper than that by amiodarone (5% per decade, +10 to +20 mV). Block by quinidine was time dependent at negative potentials: on stepping from +50 to -30 mV, block initially increased very rapidly, and subsequent deactivation of IK was slowed. This effect was not seen with amiodarone. At -80 mV, quinidine block was relieved with a time constant of 40 +/- 15 msec (n = 4, twin-pulse protocol). The effects of quinidine on IK were compatible with neither a purely voltage-dependent model of quinidine binding nor a model incorporating both voltage- and state-dependent binding of quinidine to delayed rectifier channels having only one open state. The voltage- and time-dependent features of quinidine block were well described by a model in which quinidine has greater affinity for one of two open states of the channel. We conclude that the effects of quinidine and amiodarone on time-dependent outward current reflects block of multiple channels. Quinidine block of IK was far more voltage dependent than that produced by amiodarone, suggesting the drugs act by different mechanisms.

2429962|t|Prothrombin requires two sequential metal-dependent conformational transitions to bind phospholipid. Conformation-specific antibodies directed against the phospholipid-binding site on prothrombin.
2429962|a|Prothrombin is a gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein that binds to phospholipid vesicles in the presence of calcium ions after undergoing a metal ion-induced conformational transition. To integrate recent data into a scheme that is compatible with our knowledge of prothrombin-metal interaction, we have proposed a new model of prothrombin structure. In this model prothrombin undergoes two metal-dependent conformational transitions: PT----PT'----PT*. The first transition is not cation-specific, but the second transition is metal-selective for Ca(II), Sr(II), or Ba(II). Only the PT* conformer binds to phospholipid surfaces. To test this model, anti-prothrombin antibodies that only bind to prothrombin in the presence of Ca(II) but not Mg(II) (PT*-specific) were isolated, and termed anti-prothrombin X Ca(II)-specific. Half-maximal binding of antibody to prothrombin was observed at 0.1 mM CaCl2 or 1 mM SrCl2, but no binding was observed with Mg(II), Mn(II), or Ba(II). However, prothrombin in the presence of both Mg(II)/Ba(II) or Mn(II)/Ba(II) demonstrated significant interaction with the antibody. Prothrombin binding to phospholipid vesicles was inhibited by the anti-prothrombin X Ca(II)-specific antibody or its Fab fragment, but was not inhibited by anti-prothrombin X Mg(II) antibody or its Fab fragment directed at the PT' conformer. These results support this three-state model for prothrombin. The metal specificity characteristic of prothrombin-phospholipid interaction is a property required for the expression of the phospholipid-binding site in the binary prothrombin-metal complex.

11375777|t|Glutamate signalling in bone.
11375777|a|The identification of novel signalling pathways in a tissue provides new avenues for pharmacological manipulation of tissue function. Where the pathway concerned is one that has been the subject of extensive research in another body system, progress towards new therapies can be rapid. The discovery that glutamate has functions in bone that share striking similarities with its role in synaptic neurotransmission opens the way to manipulate skeletal pathophysiology using modulators of glutamate release, uptake or receptor function. The purpose of this review is to describe the way that a role for glutamate as a signalling molecule in bone was discovered, to summarise the evidence for this role. In addition, it will identify points that are unresolved, to highlight areas where new research could provide significant advances. Furthermore, it will indicate how studies already performed but analysed without consideration of the non-neuronal functions of modulators of glutamate signalling, could contain information of significant value for the advance of therapeutic approaches to bone diseases.

12453678|t|Receptor for advanced glycation endproducts: a multiligand receptor magnifying cell stress in diverse pathologic settings.
12453678|a|Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules capable of interacting with a broad spectrum of ligands, including advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), amyloid fibrils, S100/calgranulins and amphoterin. The biology of RAGE is dictated by the accumulation of these ligands at pathologic sites, leading to upregulation of the receptor and sustained RAGE-dependent cell activation eventuating in cellular dysfunction. Although RAGE is not central to the initial pathogenesis of disorders in which it ultimately appears to be involved, such as diabetes, amyloidoses, inflammatory conditions and tumors (each of these conditions leading to accumulation of RAGE ligands), the receptor functions as a progression factor driving cellular dysfunction and exaggerating the host response towards tissue destruction, rather than restitution of homeostasis. These observations suggest that RAGE might represent a therapeutic target in a diverse group of seemingly unrelated disorders linked only by a multiligand receptor with an unusually wide and diverse repertoire of ligands, namely, RAGE.

12773158|t|United at last: the tuberous sclerosis complex gene products connect the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling.
12773158|a|The molecular interplay between the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling in the control of cell growth and proliferation has been the subject of much interest and debate amongst cell biologists. A recent escalation of research in this area has come from the discovery of the tuberous sclerosis complex gene products, tuberin and hamartin, as central regulators of mTOR activation. The PI3K effector Akt/protein kinase B has been found to directly phosphorylate tuberin and is thereby thought to activate mTOR through inhibition of the tuberin-hamartin complex. The many recent studies aimed at defining the molecular nature of this revamped PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway are reviewed here. The collective data discussed have laid the groundwork for important new insights into the many cancers caused by aberrant PI3K activation and the clinically challenging tuberous sclerosis complex disease and have suggested a possible means of treatment for both.

8628395|t|Hyperlocomotion and indifference to cocaine and amphetamine in mice lacking the dopamine transporter.
8628395|a|Disruption of the mouse dopamine transporter gene results in spontaneous hyperlocomotion despite major adaptive changes, such as decreases in neurotransmitter and receptor levels. In homozygote mice, dopamine persists at least 100 times longer in the extracellular space, explaining the biochemical basis of the hyperdopaminergic phenotype and demonstrating the critical role of the transporter in regulating neurotransmission. The dopamine transporter is an obligatory target of cocaine and amphetamine, as these psychostimulants have no effect on locomotor activity or dopamine release and uptake in mice lacking the transporter.

9705512|t|Mutational analysis of the 3'-->5' proofreading exonuclease of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III.
9705512|a|The epsilon subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, the enzyme primarily responsible for the duplication of the bacterial chromosome, is a 3'-->5' exonuclease that functions as a proofreader for polymerase errors. In addition, it plays an important structural role within the pol III core. To gain further insight into how epsilon performs these joint structural and catalytic functions, we have investigated a set of 20 newly isolated dnaQ mutator mutants. The mutator effects ranged from strong (700-8000-fold enhancement) to moderate (6-20-fold enhancement), reflecting the range of proofreading deficiencies. Complementation assays revealed most mutators to be partially or fully dominant, suggesting that they carried an exonucleolytic defect but retained binding to the pol III core subunits. One allele, containing a stop codon 3 amino acids from the C-terminal end of the protein, was fully recessive. Sequence analysis of the mutants revealed mutations in the Exo I, Exo II and recently proposed Exo IIIepsilon motifs, as well as in the intervening regions. Together, the data support the functional significance of the proposed motifs, presumably in catalysis, and suggest that the C-terminus of straightepsilon may be specifically involved in binding to the alpha (polymerase) subunit.

2642759|t|High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular disease. Four prospective American studies.
2642759|a|The British Regional Heart Study (BRHS) reported in 1986 that much of the inverse relation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and incidence of coronary heart disease was eliminated by covariance adjustment. Using the proportional hazards model and adjusting for age, blood pressure, smoking, body mass index, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we analyzed this relation separately in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Mortality Follow-up Study (LRCF) and Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (CPPT), and Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT). In CPPT and MRFIT (both randomized trials in middle-age high-risk men), only the control groups were analyzed. A 1-mg/dl (0.026 mM) increment in HDLC was associated with a significant coronary heart disease risk decrement of 2% in men (FHS, CPPT, and MRFIT) and 3% in women (FHS). In LRCF, where only fatal outcomes were documented, a 1-mg/dl increment in HDLC was associated with significant 3.7% (men) and 4.7% (women) decrements in cardiovascular disease mortality rates. The 95% confidence intervals for these decrements in coronary heart and cardiovascular disease risk in the four studies overlapped considerably, and all contained the range 1.9-2.9%. HDLC levels were essentially unrelated to non-cardiovascular disease mortality. When differences in analytic methodology were eliminated, a consistent inverse relation of HDLC levels and coronary heart disease event rates was apparent in BRHS as well as in the four American studies.

15562820|t|Circulating IGF-1 and its role in cancer: lessons from the IGF-1 gene deletion (LID) mouse.
15562820|a|Recent epidemiological studies have suggested a statistical connection between serum IGF-1 levels in the upper quartile of the normal range and the relative risk of developing certain cancers. Our studies have focused on mouse models where circulating IGF-1 levels are reduced, while tissue expression of IGF-1 is normal. These mice show a lower risk for the development of colon and breast cancers and metastases when compared with control mice, and lend support to the hypothesis that circulating IGF-1 may be linked to cancer cell growth.

15192014|a|NF-kappaB activation is required for TNF-alpha-induced transformation of JB6 mouse epidermal cells. Deficient activation of p65 contributes to the lack of NF-kappaB activation in transformation-resistant (P-) cells. We hypothesized that the differential NF-kappaB activation involves differential p65 phosphorylation arising from enzyme activity differences. Here we show that TNF-alpha induces greater ERK-dependent p65 phosphorylation at S536 in transformation sensitive (P+) cells than in P- cells. Our results establish that limited ERK content contributes to a low IkappaB kinase (IKKbeta) level, in turn resulting in insufficient p65 phosphorylation at S536 upon TNF-alpha stimulation in P- cells. Phosphorylation of p65 at S536 appears to play a role in TNF-alpha-induced p65 DNA binding and recruitment of p300 to the p65 complex as well as in release of p65 bound to HDAC1 and 3. Blocking p65 phosphorylation at S536, but not at S276 or S529, abolishes p65 transactivational activity. Over-expression of p65 but not p65 phosphorylation mutant (S536A) in transformation-resistant P- cells renders these cells sensitive to TNF-alpha-induced transformation. Over-expression of p65 phosphorylation mimics p65-S536D or p65-S536E in P- cells and also rescues the transformation response. These findings provide direct evidence that phosphorylation of p65 at S536 is required for TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation in the JB6 transformation model. The lack of NF-kappaB activation seen in P- cells can be attributed to an insufficient level of p65 phosphorylation on S536 that arises from insufficient IKKbeta that in turn arises from insufficient ERK. Thus, p65 phosphorylation at S536 offers a potential molecular target for cancer prevention.

12687686|t|Neg, a nerve growth factor-stimulated gene expressed by fetal neocortical neurons that is downregulated by ethanol.
12687686|a|Neurotrophins are critical for neuronal development, plasticity, and survival. Ethanol affects these processes. We tested the hypothesis that ethanol inhibits nerve growth factor (NGF)-stimulated gene expression. Dissociated cultures of fetal cortical neurons were treated with NGF and/or ethanol. NGF sustained cell viability and reduced the incidence of terminal uridylated nick-end labeling and pyknosis. Ethanol eliminated these effects and induced neuronal death. Differential display of mRNA showed that one gene fragment (245 bp) was expressed by cells treated with NGF alone; ethanol blocked its expression. This fragment, named neg (nerve growth factor-stimulated, ethanol-depressed gene), has high nucleotide identity with genes from human myeloid cells and murine lymphocytes. Ribonuclease protection assay and in situ hybridization verified NGF upregulation and ethanol antagonism. Thus, ethanol specifically alters the expression of a gene that appears to be involved in NGF-mediated neuroprotection.

20136693|t|Oestrogen receptors enhance dopamine neurone survival in rat midbrain.
20136693|a|Previous findings in our laboratory and elsewhere have shown that ovariectomy of rats in adulthood attenuates cocaine-stimulated locomotor behaviour. Ovarian hormones enhance both cocaine-stimulated behaviour and increase dopamine overflow after psychomotor stimulants. The present study aimed to determine whether ovarian hormones have these effects in part by maintaining dopamine neurone number in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) and to investigate the roles of specific oestrogen receptors (ERs) in the maintenance of mesencephalic dopamine neurones. To accomplish this goal, we used unbiased stereological techniques to estimate the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-IR) cell bodies in midbrain regions of intact, ovariectomised and hormone-replaced female rats and mice. Animals received active or sham gonadectomy on postnatal day 60 and received vehicle, 17beta-oestradiol (E(2)) or selective ER agonists propyl-pyrazole-triol (PPT, ERalpha) or diarylpropionitrile (DPN, ERbeta) for 1 month post-surgery. In both rats and mice, ovariectomy reduced the number of TH-IR cells in the SNpc and VTA. Replacement with E(2), PPT or DPN prevented or attenuated the loss observed with ovariectomy in both rats and mice. An additional study using ER knockout mice revealed that adult female mice lacking ERalpha had fewer TH-IR cells in midbrain regions than wild-type mice, whereas mice lacking ERbeta had TH-IR cell counts comparable to wild-type. These findings suggest that, although both ER subtypes play a role in the maintenance of TH-IR cell number in the SNpc and VTA, ERalpha may play a more significant role.

22634377|t|Post-translational modifications of TRF1 and TRF2 and their roles in telomere maintenance.
22634377|a|Telomeres, heterochromatic structures, found at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes, function to protect natural chromosome ends from nucleolytic attack. Human telomeric DNA is bound by a telomere-specific six-subunit protein complex, termed shelterin/telosome. The shelterin subunits TRF1 and TRF2 bind in a sequence-specific manner to double-stranded telomeric DNA, providing a vital platform for recruitment of additional shelterin proteins as well as non-shelterin factors crucial for the maintenance of telomere length and structure. Both TRF1 and TRF2 are engaged in multiple roles at telomeres including telomere protection, telomere replication, sister telomere resolution and telomere length maintenance. Regulation of TRF1 and TRF2 in these various processes is controlled by post-translational modifications, at times in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, affecting key functions such as DNA binding, dimerization, localization, degradation and interactions with other proteins. Here we review the post-translational modifications of TRF1 and TRF2 and discuss the mechanisms by which these modifications contribute to the function of these two proteins.

2866173|t|Effect of benzodiazepine hypnotics on all-night sleep EEG spectra.
2866173|a|The effect of a single, oral bedtime dose of the benzodiazepine hypnotics flunitrazepam (FR; 2 mg), flurazepam (FR; 30 mg), and triazolam (TR; 0.5 mg) on the sleep stages and the sleep EEG was investigated in eight healthy, young subjects. In comparison to the placebo night, all drugs reduced the percentage of stage 1 and REM sleep, increased stage 2, and decreased the number of stage shifts. For FN and FR, some of these changes persisted in the postdrug night. All-night spectral analysis of the EEG showed a reduction of low-frequency activity (0.25-10.0 Hz) in stages 2, 3 + 4 and REM sleep, changes that persisted for all three drugs in the post-drug night. In the drug nights, activity in the spindle frequency range (11-14 Hz) was enhanced particularly in stage 2 and 3 + 4, activity in the high frequency range (17-25 Hz) particularly in REM sleep and stage 1. In the first third of the drug night, the depression of low-frequency activity in stage 2 was either absent (FR) or less prominent (FN, TR) than in the following part of the night. The results demonstrate that benzodiazepine hypnotics induce specific changes in the EEG spectra which reflect the immediate and residual drug effects more sensitively than conventional sleep scores.

22230955|t|X-ray structures of LeuT in substrate-free outward-open and apo inward-open states.
22230955|a|Neurotransmitter sodium symporters are integral membrane proteins that remove chemical transmitters from the synapse and terminate neurotransmission mediated by serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, glycine and GABA (y-aminobutyric acid). Crystal structures of the bacterial homologue, LeuT, in substrate-bound outward-occluded and competitive inhibitor-bound outward-facing states have advanced our mechanistic understanding of neurotransmitter sodium symporters but have left fundamental questions unanswered. Here we report crystal structures of LeuT mutants in complexes with conformation-specific antibody fragments in the outward-open and inward-open states. In the absence of substrate but in the presence of sodium the transporter is outward-open, illustrating how the binding of substrate closes the extracellular gate through local conformational changes: hinge-bending movements of the extracellular halves of transmembrane domains 1, 2 and 6, together with translation of extracellular loop 4. The inward-open conformation, by contrast, involves large-scale conformational changes, including a reorientation of transmembrane domains 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, a marked hinge bending of transmembrane domain 1a and occlusion of the extracellular vestibule by extracellular loop 4. These changes close the extracellular gate, open an intracellular vestibule, and largely disrupt the two sodium sites, thus providing a mechanism by which ions and substrate are released to the cytoplasm. The new structures establish a structural framework for the mechanism of neurotransmitter sodium symporters and their modulation by therapeutic and illicit substances.

10634944|t|The utilization of recombinant prostanoid receptors to determine the affinities and selectivities of prostaglandins and related analogs.
10634944|a|Stable cell lines that individually express the eight known human prostanoid receptors (EP(1), EP(2), EP(3), EP(4), DP, FP, IP and TP) have been established using human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293(EBNA) cells. These recombinant cell lines have been employed in radioligand binding assays to determine the equilibrium inhibitor constants of known prostanoid receptor ligands at these eight receptors. This has allowed, for the first time, an assessment of the affinity and selectivity of several novel compounds at the individual human prostanoid receptors. This information should facilitate interpretation of pharmacological studies that employ these ligands as tools to study human tissues and cell lines and should, therefore, result in a greater understanding of prostanoid receptor biology.

19047137|t|The ARF tumor suppressor can promote the progression of some tumors.
19047137|a|p14/p19ARF (ARF) is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently mutated in human cancer. ARF has multiple tumor suppressor functions, some of which are mediated by signaling to p53. Surprisingly, a significant fraction of human tumors retain persistently high levels of ARF, suggesting that ARF may possess a prosurvival function. We show that ARF protein is markedly up-regulated in cells exposed to nutrient starvation. Cells with silenced ARF show reduced autophagy and reduced viability when placed under conditions of starvation. We show for the first time that ARF silencing can limit the progression of some tumors, such as lymphoma, but not others, such as E1A/Ras-induced tumors. Specifically, myc-driven lymphomas with mutant p53 tend to overexpress ARF; we show that silencing ARF in these tumors greatly impedes their progression. These data are the first to show that ARF can act in a p53-independent manner to promote the progression of some tumors.

12033941|t|Rational design of artificial zinc-finger proteins using a nondegenerate recognition code table.
12033941|a|We have developed a novel and simple method to rationally design artificial zinc-finger proteins (AZPs) targeting diverse DNA sequences using a nondegenerate recognition code table. The table was constructed based on known and potential DNA base-amino acid interactions. The table permits identification of an amino acid for each position (-1, 2, 3, and 6) of the alpha-helical region of the zinc-finger domain (position 1 is the starting amino acid in the alpha-helix) from overlapping 4-bp sequences in a given DNA target. Based on the table, we designed ten 3-finger AZPs, each of which targeted an arbitrarily chosen 10-bp DNA sequence, and characterized the binding properties. In vitro DNA-binding assays showed five of the AZPs tightly and specifically bound to their targets containing more than three guanine bases in the first 9-bp region. In addition, 6-finger AZPs, each of which was produced by combining two functional 3-finger AZPs, bound to their 19-bp targets with the dissociation constant of less than 3 pM. The in vivo functionality of the AZP was tested using Arabidopsis protoplasts. The AZP fused to a transcriptional activation domain efficiently activated expression of a reporter gene linked to a native promoter containing the AZP target site. Our simple AZP design method will provide a powerful approach to manipulation of endogenous gene expression by enabling rapid creation of numerous artificial DNA-binding proteins.

10542248|t|Biosynthesis of vascular endothelial growth factor-D involves proteolytic processing which generates non-covalent homodimers.
10542248|a|Vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D) binds and activates the endothelial cell tyrosine kinase receptors VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and VEGF receptor-3 (VEGFR-3), is mitogenic for endothelial cells, and shares structural homology and receptor specificity with VEGF-C. The primary translation product of VEGF-D has long N- and C-terminal polypeptide extensions in addition to a central VEGF homology domain (VHD). The VHD of VEGF-D is sufficient to bind and activate VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. Here we report that VEGF-D is proteolytically processed to release the VHD. Studies in 293EBNA cells demonstrated that VEGF-D undergoes N- and C-terminal cleavage events to produce numerous secreted polypeptides including a fully processed form of M(r) approximately 21,000 consisting only of the VHD, which is predominantly a non-covalent dimer. Biosensor analysis demonstrated that the VHD has approximately 290- and approximately 40-fold greater affinity for VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, respectively, compared with unprocessed VEGF-D. In situ hybridization demonstrated that embryonic lung is a major site of expression of the VEGF-D gene. Processed forms of VEGF-D were detected in embryonic lung indicating that VEGF-D is proteolytically processed in vivo.

16505385|t|New insights into myosin evolution and classification.
16505385|a|Myosins are eukaryotic actin-dependent molecular motors important for a broad range of functions like muscle contraction, vision, hearing, cell motility, and host cell invasion of apicomplexan parasites. Myosin heavy chains consist of distinct head, neck, and tail domains and have previously been categorized into 18 different classes based on phylogenetic analysis of their conserved heads. Here we describe a comprehensive phylogenetic examination of many previously unclassified myosins, with particular emphasis on sequences from apicomplexan and other chromalveolate protists including the model organism Toxoplasma, the malaria parasite Plasmodium, and the ciliate Tetrahymena. Using different phylogenetic inference methods and taking protein domain architectures, specific amino acid polymorphisms, and organismal distribution into account, we demonstrate a hitherto unrecognized common origin for ciliate and apicomplexan class XIV myosins. Our data also suggest common origins for some apicomplexan myosins and class VI, for classes II and XVIII, for classes XII and XV, and for some microsporidian myosins and class V, thereby reconciling evolutionary history and myosin structure in several cases and corroborating the common coevolution of myosin head, neck, and tail domains. Six novel myosin classes are established to accommodate sequences from chordate metazoans (class XIX), insects (class XX), kinetoplastids (class XXI), and apicomplexans and diatom algae (classes XXII, XXIII, and XXIV). These myosin (sub)classes include sequences with protein domains (FYVE, WW, UBA, ATS1-like, and WD40) previously unknown to be associated with myosin motors. Regarding the apicomplexan "myosome," we significantly update class XIV classification, propose a systematic naming convention, and discuss possible functions in these parasites.

12767397|t|Synthesis and biological evaluation of a fluorine-18 labeled estrogen receptor-alpha selective ligand: [18F] propyl pyrazole triol.
12767397|a|The two estrogen receptor subtypes, ERalpha and ERbeta, play important roles in breast cancer. To develop an ERalpha imaging agent, we synthesized fluoropropyl pyrazole triol (FPPT, 2), an analog of our ERalpha-selective ligand PPT. FPPT retains the high ERalpha binding selectivity of its parent PPT. We prepared [(18)F]FPPT ((18)F-2) in high specific activity, but estrogen target tissue uptake in female rats was minimal and was not displaceable by unlabeled estradiol, probably because of the lipophilicity and triphenolic nature of FPPT.

16758119|t|Interaction of genetic polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 2E1 and glutathione S-transferase M1 to breast cancer in Taiwanese woman without smoking and drinking habits.
16758119|a|P450 (CYP) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) are involved in the activation and detoxification of many potential carcinogens. Although, the interaction between environmental exposure and genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) in breast cancer has been assessed, the gene-gene interactions between CYP2E1 and GSTM1 related to breast cancer have not been focused on and reported. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study to investigate whether the genetic interaction effects of CYP2E1 and GSTM1 modify the risk of developing breast cancer independent of the effect of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. Individuals with the C2/C2 genotype of CYP2E1 had a lower risk (OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.08-0.74) when compared with those with the C1/C1 genotype. However, there was no significant difference (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.73-1.50) in the GSTM1 genotype frequency between the cases with breast cancer and that of the controls. When individuals with the genotype of C1/C1 or C1/C2 of CYP2E1 and the wild-type of GSTM1 were compared with those of C2/C2 of CYP2E1 and the null-type of GSTM1 however, we found a significantly increased risk (OR = 3.50, 95% CI = 1.01-16.55) in the breast cancer patients. Our findings indicated a gene-gene interaction between CYP2E1 and GSTM1 was accessible to developing breast cancer in Taiwanese women without the habits of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption even though independent effects of CYP2E1 and GSTM1 were weak or non-significant and suggest that environmental carcinogen besides cigarette and alcohol consumption could induce breast cancer.

18708085|t|Signaling by G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR): studies on the GnRH receptor.
18708085|a|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the first key hormone of reproduction. GnRH analogs are extensively used in in vitro fertilization, and treatment of sex hormone-dependent cancers, due to their ability to bring about 'chemical castration'. The interaction of GnRH with its cognate type I receptor (GnRHR) in pituitary gonadotropes results in the activation of Gq/G(11), phospholipase Cbeta (PLCbetaI), PLA(2), and PLD. Sequential activation of the phospholipases generates the second messengers inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP(3)), diacylglycerol (DAG), and arachidonic acid (AA), which are required for Ca(2+) mobilization, the activation of various protein kinase C isoforms (PKCs), and the production of prostaglandin (PG) and other metabolites of AA, respectively. PKC isoforms are the major mediators of the downstream activation of a number of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades by GnRH, namely: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38MAPK. The activated MAPKs phosphorylate both cytosolic and nuclear proteins to initiate the transcriptional activation of the gonadotropin subunit genes and the GnRHR. While Ca(2+) mobilization has been found to initiate rapid gonadotropin secretion, Ca(2+), together with various PKC isoforms, MAPKs and AA metabolites also serve as key nodes, in the GnRH-stimulated signaling network that enables the gonadotropes to decode GnRH pulse frequencies and translating that into differential gonadotropin synthesis and release. Even though pulsatility of GnRH is recognized as a major determinant for differential gonadotropin subunit gene expression and gonadotropin secretion very little is yet known about the signaling circuits governing GnRH action at the 'Systems Biology' level. Direct apoptotic and metastatic effects of GnRH analogs in gonadal steroid-dependent cancers expressing the GnRHR also seem to be mediated by the activation of the PKC/MAPK pathways. However, the mechanisms dictating life (pituitary) vs. death (cancer) decisions made by the same GnRHR remain elusive. Understanding these molecular mechanisms triggered by the GnRHR through biochemical and 'Systems Biology' approaches would provide the basis for the construction of the dynamic connectivity maps, which operate in the various cell types (endocrine, cancer, and immune system) targeted by GnRH. The connectivity maps will open a new vista for exploring the direct effects of GnRH analogs in tumors and the design of novel combined therapies for fertility control, reproductive disorders and cancers.

22021672|t|Endocannabinoid hydrolysis generates brain prostaglandins that promote neuroinflammation.
22021672|a|Phospholipase A(2)(PLA(2)) enzymes are considered the primary source of arachidonic acid for cyclooxygenase (COX)-mediated biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Here, we show that a distinct pathway exists in brain, where monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) hydrolyzes the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol to generate a major arachidonate precursor pool for neuroinflammatory prostaglandins. MAGL-disrupted animals show neuroprotection in a parkinsonian mouse model. These animals are spared the hemorrhaging caused by COX inhibitors in the gut, where prostaglandins are instead regulated by cytosolic PLA(2). These findings identify MAGL as a distinct metabolic node that couples endocannabinoid to prostaglandin signaling networks in the nervous system and suggest that inhibition of this enzyme may be a new and potentially safer way to suppress the proinflammatory cascades that underlie neurodegenerative disorders.

16445986|t|Ceramides in insulin resistance and lipotoxicity.
16445986|a|Obesity predisposes individuals to the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and the liver, and researchers have recently proposed two mechanisms by which excess adiposity antagonizes insulin action in peripheral tissues. First, when adipocytes exceed their storage capacity, fat begins to accumulate in tissues not suited for lipid storage, leading to the formation of specific metabolites that inhibit insulin signal transduction. Second, obesity triggers a chronic inflammatory state, and cytokines released from either adipocytes or from macrophages infiltrating adipose tissue antagonize insulin action. The sphingolipid ceramide is a putative intermediate linking both excess nutrients (i.e. saturated fatty acids) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha, TNFalpha) to the induction of insulin resistance. Moreover, ceramide has been shown to be toxic in a variety of different cell types (e.g. pancreatic beta-cells, cardiomyocytes, etc.), and review of the literature reveals putative roles for the sphingolipid in the damage of cells and tissues which accompany diabetes, hypertension, cardiac failure, atherosclerosis, etc. In this review, I will evaluate the contribution of ceramides in the development of insulin resistance and the complications associated with metabolic diseases.

9523552|t|Distribution of mRNAs encoding the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, beta, and gamma and the retinoid X receptor alpha, beta, and gamma in rat central nervous system.
9523552|a|We report the isolation, by RT-PCR, of partial cDNAs encoding the rat peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms PPAR alpha, PPAR beta, and PPAR gamma and the rat retinoid X receptor (RXR) isoforms RXR alpha, RXR beta, and RXR gamma. These cDNAs were used to generate antisense RNA probes to permit analysis, by the highly sensitive and discriminatory RNase protection assay, of the corresponding mRNAs in rat brain regions during development. PPAR alpha, PPAR beta, RXR alpha, and RXR beta mRNAs are ubiquitously present in different brain regions during development, PPAR gamma mRNA is essentially undetectable, and RXR gamma mRNA is principally localised to cortex. We demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of PPAR and RXR mRNAs in primary cultures of neonatal meningeal fibroblasts, cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs), and cortical and cerebellar astrocytes and in primary cultures of adult cortical astrocytes. PPAR alpha, PPAR beta, RXR alpha, and RXR beta mRNAs are present in all cell types, albeit that PPAR alpha and RXR alpha mRNAs are at levels near the limit of detection in CGNs. PPAR gamma mRNA is expressed at low levels in most cell types but is present at levels similar to those of PPAR alpha mRNA in adult astrocytes. RXR gamma mRNA is present either at low levels, or below the level of detection of the assay, for all cell types studied.

18226465|t|Valproic acid as epigenetic cancer drug: preclinical, clinical and transcriptional effects on solid tumors.
18226465|a|Among many anticancer drugs collectively named "targeted or molecular therapies" epigenetic drugs are clearly promising. Differently from other agents targeting a single gene product, epigenetic drugs have chromatin as their target through inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) therefore, yet unspecific, they may act upon most or all tumor types, as deregulation of the methylation and deacetylation machinery are a common hallmark of neoplasia. In the last years, valproic acid (VPA) as emerged as a promising drug for cancer treatment. VPA has shown potent antitumor effects in a variety of in vitro and in vivo systems, and encouraging results in early clinical trials either alone or in combination with demethylating and/or cytotoxic agents. In addition, whole genome expression by microarray analysis from the primary tumors of patients treated with VPA show significant up-regulation of hundred of genes belonging to multiple pathways including ribosomal proteins, oxidative phosphorylation, MAPK signaling; focal adhesion, cell cycle, antigen processing and presentation, proteasome, apoptosis, PI3K, Wnt signaling, calcium signaling, TGF-beta signaling, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis among others. Despite in general, industry is not particularly interested in funding the clinical development of VPA, -at least in comparison to novel HDAC inhibitors-, existing preclinical and preliminary clinical data strongly suggest that VPA could be a drug that eventually will be used in combination therapies, either with classical cytotoxics, other molecular-targeted drugs or radiation in a number of solid tumors.

22661711|t|Retinoic acid receptors recognize the mouse genome through binding elements with diverse spacing and topology.
22661711|a|Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) heterodimerize with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and bind to RA response elements (RAREs) in the regulatory regions of their target genes. Although previous studies on limited sets of RA-regulated genes have defined canonical RAREs as direct repeats of the consensus RGKTCA separated by 1, 2, or 5 nucleotides (DR1, DR2, DR5), we show that in mouse embryoid bodies or F9 embryonal carcinoma cells, RARs occupy a large repertoire of sites with DR0, DR8, and IR0 (inverted repeat 0) elements. Recombinant RAR-RXR binds these non-canonical spacings in vitro with comparable affinities to DR2 and DR5. Most DR8 elements comprise three half-sites with DR2 and DR0 spacings. This specific half-site organization constitutes a previously unrecognized but frequent signature of RAR binding elements. In functional assays, DR8 and IR0 elements act as independent RAREs, whereas DR0 does not. Our results reveal an unexpected diversity in the spacing and topology of binding elements for the RAR-RXR heterodimer. The differential ability of RAR-RXR bound to DR0 compared to DR2, DR5, and DR8 to mediate RA-dependent transcriptional activation indicates that half-site spacing allosterically regulates RAR function.

16496354|t|Basic fibroblast growth factor endows dorsal telencephalic neural progenitors with the ability to differentiate into oligodendrocytes but not gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons.
16496354|a|Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is commonly used to enrich and maintain neural stem cells in vitro. Olig2 is an essential transcription factor for oligodendrocyte lineage specification and is expressed predominantly in ventral neuroepithelial cells in the medial and lateral ganglionic eminence (GE), where oligodendrocyte progenitors originate. Here we report significant induction of Olig2 expression in dorsal neuroepithelium-derived cells cultured in the presence of bFGF, in which Olig2-expressing cells were initially negligible. Among Olig2-expressing cells appearing after a 5-day treatment with bFGF, 99.8% coexpressed nestin. There was no significant difference in proliferation or apoptosis in dorsal and ventral neuroepithelial cultures in the presence of bFGF, suggesting that bFGF induces ectopic expression of Olig2 in dorsal "cortical" neuroepithelial cells. Similarly, expression of Mash1, another ventral neuroepithelial cell marker gene, was also induced in cultured dorsal neuroepithelial cells in the presence of bFGF. Conversely, in this culture, expression of dorsal neuroepithelial cell markers, such as Neurogenin1, Neurogenin2, Pax6, and Emx2, was down-regulated. These results suggested a possible ventralizing activity of bFGF. In fact, bFGF-treated dorsal neuroepithelial cells acquired the potential to generate O4-positive oligodendrocytes with efficacy comparable to that observed with GE-derived cells. In marked contrast, bFGF did not enable dorsal neuroepithelial cells to generate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons, which normally develop only from GE in vivo. Thus, bFGF endows dorsal telencephalic neural progenitors with the ability to differentiate into oligodendrocytes but not GABAergic neurons, suggesting the presence of different mechanisms governing specification of dorsoventral cell identities of neuronal and glial cell lineages.

9334387|t|The effect of peripherin/rds haploinsufficiency on rod and cone photoreceptors.
9334387|a|Haploinsufficiency because of a null mutation in the gene encoding peripherin/rds has been thought to be the primary defect associated with the photoreceptor degeneration seen in the retinal degeneration slow (rds) mouse. We have compared the effects of this haploinsufficiency on rod and cone photoreceptors by measuring the levels of rod- and cone-specific gene expression, by determining the relative rates of rod and cone degeneration, and by electroretinography. These analyses were performed at ages before and after the onset of degeneration of the photoreceptor cells. The data were consistent in demonstrating that measures for cone photoreceptors are relatively spared in comparison to comparable measures for rod photoreceptors. Blue cones were retained in higher number than red/green cones for the first 3 months of the degeneration. Our results indicate that the haploinsufficiency present in rds/+ mice has a greater impact on the rod than on the cone photoreceptor, a finding that likely reflects the tight regulation of peripherin/rds and the need for two functional alleles to assemble the structure of the rod outer segment and/or differences between the ultrastructure of the rod and cone outer segments.

8864119|t|TNF- and cancer therapy-induced apoptosis: potentiation by inhibition of NF-kappaB.
8864119|a|Many cells are resistant to stimuli that can induce apoptosis, but the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. The activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), ionizing radiation, or daunorubicin (a cancer chemotherapeutic compound), was found to protect from cell killing. Inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation enhanced apoptotic killing by these reagents but not by apoptotic stimuli that do not activate NF-kappaB. These results provide a mechanism of cellular resistance to killing by some apoptotic reagents, offer insight into a new role for NF-kappaB, and have potential for improvement of the efficacy of cancer therapies.

16293764|t|Regulation of yeast replicative life span by TOR and Sch9 in response to nutrients.
16293764|a|Calorie restriction increases life span in many organisms, including the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. From a large-scale analysis of 564 single-gene-deletion strains of yeast, we identified 10 gene deletions that increase replicative life span. Six of these correspond to genes encoding components of the nutrient-responsive TOR and Sch9 pathways. Calorie restriction of tor1D or sch9D cells failed to further increase life span and, like calorie restriction, deletion of either SCH9 or TOR1 increased life span independent of the Sir2 histone deacetylase. We propose that the TOR and Sch9 kinases define a primary conduit through which excess nutrient intake limits longevity in yeast.

9305847|t|A model for p53-induced apoptosis.
9305847|a|The inactivation of the p53 gene in a large proportion of human cancers has inspired an intense search for the encoded protein's physiological and biological properties. Expression of p53 induces either a stable growth arrest or programmed cell death (apoptosis). In human colorectal cancers, the growth arrest is dependent on the transcriptional induction of the protein p21WAF1/CIP1 , but the mechanisms underlying the development of p53-dependent apoptosis are largely unknown. As the most well documented biochemical property of p53 is its ability to activate transcription of genes, we examined in detail the transcripts induced by p53 expression before the onset of apoptosis. Of 7,202 transcripts identified, only 14 (0.19%) were found to be markedly increased in p53-expressing cells compared with control cells. Strikingly, many of these genes were predicted to encode proteins that could generate or respond to oxidative stress, including one that is implicated in apoptosis in plant meristems. These observations stimulated additional biochemical and pharmacological experiments suggesting that p53 results in apoptosis through a three-step process: (1) the transcriptional induction of redox-related genes; (2) the formation of reactive oxygen species; and (3) the oxidative degradation of mitochondrial components, culminating in cell death.

8772178|t|Inhibition of protein kinase C mu by various inhibitors. Differentiation from protein kinase c isoenzymes.
8772178|a|Various inhibitors were tested for their potential to suppress the kinase activity of protein kinase C mu (PKC mu) in vitro and in vivo. Among the staurosporine-derived, rather selective PKC inhibitors the indolocarbazole G   6976 previously shown to inhibit preferentially cPKC isotypes proved to be a potent inhibitor of PKC mu with an IC50 of 20 nM, whereas the bisindolylmaleimide G   6983 was extremely ineffective in suppressing PKC mu kinase activity with a thousand-fold higher IC50 of 20 microM. Other strong inhibitors of PKC mu were the rather unspecific inhibitors staurosporine and K252a. Contrary to the poor inhibition of PKC mu by G   6983, this compound was found to suppress in vitro kinase activity of PKC isoenzymes from all three subgroups very effectively with IC50 values from 7 to 60 nM. Thus, G   6983 was able to differentiate between PKC mu and other PKC isoenzymes being useful for selective determination of PKC mu kinase activity in the presence of other PKC isoenzymes.

20574906|t|Xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme and transporter gene expression in primary cultures of human hepatocytes modulated by ToxCast chemicals.
20574906|a|Primary human hepatocyte cultures are useful in vitro model systems of human liver because when cultured under appropriate conditions the hepatocytes retain liver-like functionality such as metabolism, transport, and cell signaling. This model system was used to characterize the concentration- and time-response of the 320 ToxCast chemicals for changes in expression of genes regulated by nuclear receptors. Fourteen gene targets were monitored in quantitative nuclease protection assays: six representative cytochromes P-450, four hepatic transporters, three Phase II conjugating enzymes, and one endogenous metabolism gene involved in cholesterol synthesis. These gene targets are sentinels of five major signaling pathways: AhR, CAR, PXR, FXR, and PPARalpha. Besides gene expression, the relative potency and efficacy for these chemicals to modulate cellular health and enzymatic activity were assessed. Results demonstrated that the culture system was an effective model of chemical-induced responses by prototypical inducers such as phenobarbital and rifampicin. Gene expression results identified various ToxCast chemicals that were potent or efficacious inducers of one or more of the 14 genes, and by inference the 5 nuclear receptor signaling pathways. Significant relative risk associations with rodent in vivo chronic toxicity effects are reported for the five major receptor pathways. These gene expression data are being incorporated into the larger ToxCast predictive modeling effort.

19470704|t|Fibroblast growth factor 21 controls glycemia via regulation of hepatic glucose flux and insulin sensitivity.
19470704|a|Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a novel metabolic regulator shown to improve glycemic control. However, the molecular and functional mechanisms underlying FGF21-mediated improvements in glycemic control are not completely understood. We examined FGF21 effects on insulin sensitivity and glucose fluxes upon chronic (daily injection for 8 d) and acute (6 h infusion) administration in ob/+ and ob/ob mice. Results show that chronic FGF21 ameliorated fasting hyperglycemia in ob/ob mice via increased glucose disposal and improved hepatic insulin sensitivity. Acute FGF21 suppressed hepatic glucose production, increased liver glycogen, lowered glucagon, and improved glucose clearance in ob/+ mice. These effects were blunted in ob/ob mice. Neither chronic nor acute FGF21 altered skeletal muscle or adipose tissue glucose uptake in either genotype. In conclusion, FGF21 has potent glycemic effects caused by hepatic changes in glucose flux and improved insulin sensitivity. Thus, these studies define mechanisms underlying anti-hyperglycemic actions of FGF21 and support its therapeutic potential.

22685290|t|Elevation of highly up-regulated in liver cancer (HULC) by hepatitis B virus X protein promotes hepatoma cell proliferation via down-regulating p18.
22685290|a|Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in human cancers. It has been reported that lncRNA highly up-regulated in liver cancer (HULC) is dramatically up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) contributes importantly to the development of HCC. However, the function of HULC in HCC mediated by HBx remains unclear. Here, we report that HULC is involved in HBx-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis. We found that the expression levels of HULC were positively correlated with those of HBx in clinical HCC tissues. Moreover, we revealed that HBx up-regulated HULC in human immortalized normal liver L-O2 cells and hepatoma HepG2 cells. Luciferase reporter gene assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that HBx activated the HULC promoter via cAMP-responsive element-binding protein. We further demonstrated that HULC promoted cell proliferation by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, colony formation assay, and tumorigenicity assay. Next, we hypothesized that HULC might function through regulating a tumor suppressor gene p18 located near HULC in the same chromosome. We found that the mRNA levels of p18 were inversely correlated with those of HULC in the above clinical HCC specimens. Then, we validated that HULC down-regulated p18, which was involved in the HULC-enhanced cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we observed that knockdown of HULC could abolish the HBx-enhanced cell proliferation through up-regulating p18. Thus, we conclude that the up-regulated HULC by HBx promotes proliferation of hepatoma cells through suppressing p18. This finding provides new insight into the roles of lncRNAs in HBx-related hepatocarcinogenesis.

11050106|t|Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 has direct excitatory effects and potentiates NMDA receptor currents in neurons of the subthalamic nucleus.
11050106|a|The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a key nucleus in the basal ganglia motor circuit that provides the major glutamatergic excitatory input to the basal ganglia output nuclei. The STN plays an important role in normal motor function, as well as in pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders. Development of a complete understanding of the roles of the STN in motor control and the pathophysiological changes in STN that underlie PD will require a detailed understanding of the mechanisms involved in regulation of excitability of STN neurons. Here, we report that activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) induces a direct excitation of STN neurons that is characterized by depolarization, increased firing frequency, and increased burst-firing activity. In addition, activation of group I mGluRs induces a selective potentiation of NMDA-evoked currents. Immunohistochemical studies at the light and electron microscopic levels indicate that both subtypes of group I mGluRs (mGluR1a and mGluR5) are localized postsynaptically in the dendrites of STN neurons. Interestingly, pharmacological studies suggest that each of the mGluR-mediated effects is attributable to activation of mGluR5, not mGluR1, despite the presence of both subtypes in STN neurons. These results suggest that mGluR5 may play an important role in the net excitatory drive to the STN from glutamatergic afferents. Furthermore, these studies raise the exciting possibility that selective ligands for mGluR5 may provide a novel approach for the treatment of a variety of movement disorders that involve changes in STN activity.

16904652|t|Oxytocin increases retention of social cognition in autism.
16904652|a|BACKGROUND: Oxytocin dysfunction might contribute to the development of social deficits in autism, a core symptom domain and potential target for intervention. This study explored the effect of intravenous oxytocin administration on the retention of social information in autism. METHODS: Oxytocin and placebo challenges were administered to 15 adult subjects diagnosed with autism or Asperger's disorder, and comprehension of affective speech (happy, indifferent, angry, and sad) in neutral content sentences was tested. RESULTS: All subjects showed improvements in affective speech comprehension from pre- to post-infusion; however, whereas those who received placebo first tended to revert to baseline after a delay, those who received oxytocin first retained the ability to accurately assign emotional significance to speech intonation on the speech comprehension task. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with studies linking oxytocin to social recognition in rodents as well as studies linking oxytocin to prosocial behavior in humans and suggest that oxytocin might facilitate social information processing in those with autism. These findings also provide preliminary support for the use of oxytocin in the treatment of autism.

14694204|t|Dissociation of transactivation from transrepression by a selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist leads to separation of therapeutic effects from side effects.
14694204|a|Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the most commonly used antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs. Their outstanding therapeutic effects, however, are often accompanied by severe and sometimes irreversible side effects. For this reason, one goal of research in the GC field is the development of new drugs, which show a reduced side-effect profile while maintaining the antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive properties of classical GCs. GCs affect gene expression by both transactivation and transrepression mechanisms. The antiinflammatory effects are mediated to a major extent via transrepression, while many side effects are due to transactivation. Our aim has been to identify ligands of the GC receptor (GR), which preferentially induce transrepression with little or no transactivating activity. Here we describe a nonsteroidal selective GR-agonist, ZK 216348, which shows a significant dissociation between transrepression and transactivation both in vitro and in vivo. In a murine model of skin inflammation, ZK 216348 showed antiinflammatory activity comparable to prednisolone for both systemic and topical application. A markedly superior side-effect profile was found with regard to increases in blood glucose, spleen involution, and, to a lesser extent, skin atrophy; however, adrenocorticotropic hormone suppression was similar for both compounds. Based on these findings, ZK 216348 should have a lower risk, e.g., for induction of diabetes mellitus. The selective GR agonists therefore represent a promising previously undescribed class of drug candidates with an improved therapeutic index compared to classical GCs. Moreover, they are useful tool compounds for further investigating the mechanisms of GR-mediated effects.

7563152|t|Comparison of the effects of a pure steroidal antiestrogen with those of tamoxifen in a model of human breast cancer.
7563152|a|BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen, a nonsteroidal estrogen antagonist, is the most prescribed drug for the treatment of breast cancer. The use of tamoxifen is limited, however, by the development of resistance to this compound in most patients. Although tamoxifen behaves primarily as an estrogen antagonist, it has agonist (or growth-stimulatory) activity as well. ICI 182,780 is a 7 alpha-alkylsulfinyl analogue of estradiol lacking agonist activity. The absence of agonist activity may make this steroidal antiestrogen superior to tamoxifen in suppressing tumor cell growth. PURPOSE: We compared the inhibitory effects of ICI 182,780, tamoxifen, and estrogen withdrawal on the growth of established tumors and on tumorigenesis in a model system that uses estrogen-dependent, human MCF-7 breast tumor cells growing in athymic nude mice. We also studied the hormonal responsiveness of tumors that became resistant to the two estrogen antagonists and the effects of these drugs on estrogen-regulated gene expression. METHODS: MCF-7 cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of castrated, female nude mice. The effects of repeated doses of tamoxifen and ICI 182,780 (500 micrograms and 5 mg, respectively) on the growth of established tumors (8-10 mm in size) were determined after supplemental estrogen was removed. The effects of antiestrogen treatments on the process of tumorigenesis, in the absence of estrogen supplementation, were determined by initiating drug administration on the same day as tumor cell inoculation. To evaluate the hormonal responsiveness of tumors resistant to tamoxifen and ICI 182,780, 1-mm3 segments of the tumors were transplanted onto the flanks of new recipient mice, which were then treated with estrogen or the antiestrogens--alone or in combination. Tumor growth was monitored by measuring tumor volumes twice a week. Expression of the estrogen-responsive genes, pLIV1 and pS2, in the tumors of treated animals was analyzed using blots of total cellular RNA and complementary DNA probes. RESULTS: Treatment with ICI 182,780 suppressed the growth of established tumors twice as long as treatment with tamoxifen or estrogen withdrawal. Tumorigenesis, in the absence of supplemental estrogen, was delayed to a greater extent in ICI 182,780-treated mice than in tamoxifen-treated mice. ICI 182,780 was found to be more effective than tamoxifen in reducing the expression of estrogen-regulated genes. Most tumors eventually became resistant to ICI 182,780 and grew independently of estrogen. CONCLUSIONS: ICI 182,780 is a more effective estrogen antagonist than tamoxifen in the MCF-7 tumor cell/nude mouse model system.

17392412|t|Differential effects of CRF1 and CRF2 receptor antagonists on pain-related sensitization of neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala.
17392412|a|As a hormone in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mediates stress responses. CRF can also act as a neuromodulator of synaptic transmission outside the HPA axis. A major site of extrahypothalamic expression of CRF and its G-protein-coupled receptors is the amygdala, a key player in affect-related disorders such as anxiety. The laterocapsular division of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeLC) is important for the modulation of pain affect. This study determined the effects of CRF1 and CRF2 receptor antagonists in CeLC neurons in an arthritis pain model. Extracellular single-unit recordings were made from CeLC neurons in anesthetized adult rats. All neurons responded more strongly to noxious than to innocuous mechanical stimulation (compression) of peripheral tissues, including the knee. Evoked responses and background activity were measured before and during the development of a kaolin/carrageenan-induced knee joint arthritis. Drugs were administered into the CeLC by microdialysis before and/or after arthritis induction. All CeLC neurons showed increased responses to mechanical stimuli ("sensitization") 5-6 h postinduction of arthritis. A selective CRF1 receptor antagonist (NBI27914; 1-100 microM, concentration in microdialysis probe; 15 min) inhibited evoked responses and background activity in arthritis (n = 9) but had no effect under normal conditions before arthritis (n = 9). In contrast, a selective CRF2 receptor antagonist (Astressin-2B; 1-100 microM, 15 min) had no effect in arthritis (n = 7) but increased the neurons' responses under normal conditions (n = 8). These data suggest that CRF1 receptors in the amygdala contribute to pain-related sensitization, whereas the normally inhibitory function of CRF2 receptors is lost in the arthritis pain model.

15127388|t|Degradation and cell culture studies on block copolymers prepared by ring opening polymerization of epsilon-caprolactone in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol).
15127388|a|Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and its block copolymers with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were prepared by ring-opening polymerization of epsilon-caprolactone in the presence of ethylene glycol or PEG, using zinc metal as catalyst. The resulting polymers were characterized by various analytical techniques such as (1)H NMR, SEC, DSC, IR, X-ray, ESEM, and CZE. PCL/PEG copolymers with long PCL chains presented the same crystalline structure as PCL homopolymer, whereas PEG-bearing short PCL blocks retained the crystalline structure of PEG and exhibited an amphiphilic behavior in aqueous solutions. Degradation of PCL and PCL/PEG diblock and triblock copolymers was realized in a 0.13 M, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer at 37 degrees C. The results indicated that the copolymers exhibited higher hydrophilicity and degradability compared with the PCL homopolymer. Large amounts of PEG were released from the bulk after 60 weeks' degradation. In vitro cell culture studies were conducted on scaffolds manufactured via solid free form fabrication by using primary human and rat bone marrow derived stromal cells (hMSC, rMSC). Light, scanning electron, and confocal laser microscopy, as well as immunocytochemistry, showed cell attachment, proliferation, and extracellular matrix production on the surface, as well as inside the scaffold architecture. Copolymers showed better performance in the cell culture studies than the PCL homopolymer.

21149473|t|Prostate cancer: PET with 18F-FDG, 18F- or 11C-acetate, and 18F- or 11C-choline.
21149473|a|Prostate cancer is biologically and clinically a heterogeneous disease that makes imaging evaluation challenging. The role of imaging in prostate cancer should include diagnosis, localization, and characterization (indolent vs. lethal) of the primary tumor, determination of extracapsular spread, guidance and evaluation of local therapy in organ-confined disease, staging of locoregional lymph nodes, detection of locally recurrent and metastatic disease in biochemical relapse, planning of radiation treatment, prediction and assessment of tumor response to salvage and systemic therapy, monitoring of active surveillance and definition of a trigger for definitive therapy, and prognostication of time to hormone refractoriness in castrate disease and overall survival. To address these tasks effectively, imaging needs to be tailored to the specific phases of the disease in a patient-specific, risk-adjusted manner. In this article, I review the preclinical and clinical evidence on the potential and emerging role of PET with the 3 most commonly studied radiotracers in prostate cancer, namely 18F-FDG, 18F- or 11C-acetate, and 18F- or 11C-choline.

15567174|t|Loss of annexin A1 expression in human breast cancer detected by multiple high-throughput analyses.
15567174|a|To test the efficacy of combined high-throughput analyses (HTA) in target gene identification, screening criteria were set using >fivefold difference by microarray and statistically significant changes (p<0.01) in SAGE and EST. Microarray analysis of two normal and seven breast cancer samples found 129 genes with >fivefold changes. Further SAGE and EST analyses of these genes identified four qualified genes, ERBB2, GATA3, AGR2, and ANXA1. Their expression pattern was validated by RT-PCR in both breast cell lines and tissue samples. Loss of ANXA1 in breast cancer was further confirmed at mRNA level by Human Breast Cancer Tissue Profiling Array and at protein level by immunohistochemical staining. This study demonstrated that combined HTA effectively narrowed the number of genes for further study, while retaining the sensitivity in identifying biologically important genes such as ERBB2 and ANXA1. A distinctive loss of ANXA1 in breast cancer suggests its involvement in maintaining normal breast biology.

10358075|t|Phosphorylation of the transcription factor forkhead family member FKHR by protein kinase B.
10358075|a|Protein kinase B lies "downstream" of phosphatidylinositide (PtdIns) 3-kinase and is thought to mediate many of the intracellular actions of insulin and other growth factors. Here we show that FKHR, a human homologue of the DAF16 transcription factor in Caenorhabditis elegans, is rapidly phosphorylated by human protein kinase Balpha (PKBalpha) at Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 in vitro and at a much faster rate than BAD, which is thought to be a physiological substrate for PKB. The same three sites, which all lie in the canonical PKB consensus sequences (Arg-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-(Ser/Thr)), became phosphorylated when FKHR was cotransfected with either PKB or PDK1 (an upstream activator of PKB). All three residues became phosphorylated when 293 cells were stimulated with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). The IGF-1-induced phosphorylation was abolished by the PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin but not by PD 98059 (an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade) or by rapamycin. These results indicate that FKHR is a physiological substrate of PKB and that it may mediate some of the physiological effects of PKB on gene expression. DAF16 is known to be a component of a signaling pathway that has been partially dissected genetically and includes homologues of the insulin/IGF-1 receptor, PtdIns 3-kinase and PKB. The conservation of Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 and the sequences surrounding them in DAF16 therefore suggests that DAF16 is also a direct substrate for PKB in C. elegans.

16301204|t|The SWISS-MODEL workspace: a web-based environment for protein structure homology modelling.
16301204|a|MOTIVATION: Homology models of proteins are of great interest for planning and analysing biological experiments when no experimental three-dimensional structures are available. Building homology models requires specialized programs and up-to-date sequence and structural databases. Integrating all required tools, programs and databases into a single web-based workspace facilitates access to homology modelling from a computer with web connection without the need of downloading and installing large program packages and databases. RESULTS: SWISS-MODEL workspace is a web-based integrated service dedicated to protein structure homology modelling. It assists and guides the user in building protein homology models at different levels of complexity. A personal working environment is provided for each user where several modelling projects can be carried out in parallel. Protein sequence and structure databases necessary for modelling are accessible from the workspace and are updated in regular intervals. Tools for template selection, model building and structure quality evaluation can be invoked from within the workspace. Workflow and usage of the workspace are illustrated by modelling human Cyclin A1 and human Transmembrane Protease 3. AVAILABILITY: The SWISS-MODEL workspace can be accessed freely at http://swissmodel.expasy.org/workspace/

16533785|t|Phase I study of STX 64 (667 Coumate) in breast cancer patients: the first study of a steroid sulfatase inhibitor.
16533785|a|PURPOSE: Inhibition of steroid sulfatase (STS), the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of steroid sulfates, represents a potential novel treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone-dependent breast cancer. Estrone and DHEA are formed by this sulfatase pathway and can be converted to steroids (estradiol and androstenediol, respectively), which have potent estrogenic properties. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: STX64 (667 Coumate), a tricylic coumarin-based sulfamate that irreversibly inhibits STS activity, was selected for entry into the first phase I trial of a STS inhibitor in postmenopausal women with breast cancer. STX64 was administered orally (nine patients at 5 mg and five patients at 20 mg) as an initial dose followed 1 week later by 3 x 2 weekly cycles, with each cycle comprising daily dosing for 5 days followed by 9 days off treatment. Blood and tumor tissue samples were collected for the assessment of STS activity and serum was obtained for steroid hormone measurements before and after treatment. RESULTS: The median inhibition of STS activity by STX64 was 98% in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and 99% in breast tumor tissue at the end of the 5-day dosing period. As expected, serum concentrations of estrone, estradiol, androstenediol, and DHEA all decreased significantly from pretreatment levels. Unexpectedly, androstenedione and testosterone concentrations also decreased. Four patients, all of whom had previously progressed on aromatase inhibitors, showed evidence of stable disease for 2.75 to 7 months. The drug was well tolerated with only minor drug-related adverse events recorded. CONCLUSION: STX64 is a potent, well-tolerated STS inhibitor. It inhibits STS activity in PBLs and tumor tissues and causes significant decreases in serum concentrations of steroids with estrogenic properties.

8288598|a|To examine subunit assembly and biochemical properties of two members of the kainate family of glutamate receptors (GluR), antibodies were made to synthetic peptides corresponding to the carboxyl termini of GluR6 and KA2. Immunoblot analysis of membranes from human embryonic kidney cells transfected with glutamate receptor cDNAs showed that these antibodies are selective for their respective receptor subunit except that the antibody to GluR6 also recognizes GluR7, which is expected due to the sequence homology between the two subunits at the carboxyl terminus. In transfected cell membranes, immunoblot analysis with the antibody to GluR6 showed a major immunoreactive band at 118 kDa and minor bands at 103 and 28 kDa. The 103-kDa band appears to be a deglycosylated form of GluR6 since deglycosylation eliminates staining at 118 kDa and increases staining of the 103-kDa band. Immunoblot analysis of KA2 transfected cell membranes shows a major band at 123 kDa and minor bands at 109 and 37 kDa. Deglycosylation converts the 123-kDa band into a 109-kDa band. Analysis of brain tissues shows that both antibodies label single major bands which migrate at the same molecular masses as those from transfected cell membranes, 118 and 123 kDa for GluR6 and KA2, respectively. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that antibodies to GluR6 and KA2 selectively immunoprecipitated [3H]kainate binding activity, but not 3H-labeled alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionic acid (AMPA) binding activity, from Triton X-100-solubilized rat brain membranes. Furthermore, each antibody coimmunoprecipitated GluR6 and KA2 from cells co-transfected with GluR6 and KA2 cDNAs and from detergent-solubilized rat brain membranes, indicating that these two subunits can coassemble into a molecular complex. Interestingly, GluR1 and GluR2, subunits of the AMPA receptor, also co-immunoprecipitated with GluR6 in cells co-transfected with GluR6 and GluR1 or GluR2 cD-NAs. Such complexes appear to be present to a limited extent in the brain.

21236358|t|Analysis of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid-derived lipid metabolite formation in human and mouse blood samples.
21236358|a|Mass spectrometry techniques have enabled the identification of different lipid metabolites and mediators derived from omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 and n-3 PUFA) that are implicated in various biological processes. However, the broad-spectrum assessment of physiologically formed lipid metabolites and mediators in blood samples has not been presented so far. Here lipid mediators and metabolites of the n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid as well as the long-chain n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were measured in human blood samples as well as in mouse blood. There were detectable but mostly very low amounts of the assayed compounds in human native plasma samples, whereas in vitro activation of whole blood with the calcium ionophore A23187 led to highly significant increases of metabolite formation, with a predominance of the 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) products 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), 12-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (12-HEPE) and 14-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (14-HDHA). A23187 activation also led to significant increases in the formation of 5-LOX products including leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)), leukotriene B(5) (LTB(5)) as well as of 15-LOX products and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)). Levels were similar or even higher in A23187-activated mouse blood. The approach presented here thus provides a protocol for the comprehensive and concomitant assessment of the generation capacity of n-3 and n-6 PUFA-derived lipid metabolites as well as thromboxanes and prostaglandins in human and murine blood samples. Further studies will now have to evaluate lipid metabolite generation capacity in different physiological and pathophysiological contexts.

1717443|t|A novel species of cytochrome P-450 (P-450ib) specific for the small intestine of rabbits. cDNA cloning and its expression in COS cells.
1717443|a|We have isolated a cDNA clone for a P-450, designated P-450ib (Ichihara, K., Kusunose, E., Kaku, M., Yamamoto, S., and Kusunose, M. (1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 831, 99-105), from a cDNA library of rabbit small intestine mucosa by using synthetic DNA fragment by the polymerase chain reaction, as a hybridization probe. The cDNA with a 1,829-base pair insert encodes a polypeptide of 501 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contains all of the sequences of the NH2-terminal and 14 tryptic fragments from purified P-450ib. As the NH2-terminal methionine was not found in the sequence from the purified protein, the apoprotein of P-450ib is composed of 500 amino acids with a molecular weight of 57,193. P-450ib shows 35-41% sequence similarity with several members of 8 subfamilies in the P-450 II family, whereas it has a less than 30% sequence similarity with other P-450 families, suggesting that this P-450 is the first member of a novel subfamily within the P-450 II family. RNA blot analysis shows that mRNA hybridized to the cDNA is expressed in the small intestine, but not significantly in other tissues including liver, colon, kidney, lung, spleen, brain, stomach, and cecum, indicating that P-450ib is a P-450 specific to the small intestine. The protein expressed in COS-7 cells using the cDNA in an expression vector, pKCRH2, shows benzphetamine N-demethylase activity and gives a band identical with that of P-450ib in its mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

10570140|t|The kinetic mechanism of myosin V.
10570140|a|Myosin V is an unconventional myosin proposed to be processive on actin filaments, analogous to kinesin on a microtubule [Mehta, A. D., et al. (1999) Nature (London) 400, 590-593]. To ascertain the unique properties of myosin V that permit processivity, we undertook a detailed kinetic analysis of the myosin V motor. We expressed a truncated, single-headed myosin V construct that bound a single light chain to study its innate kinetics, free from constraints imposed by other regions of the molecule. The data demonstrate that unlike any previously characterized myosin a single-headed myosin V spends most of its kinetic cycle (>70%) strongly bound to actin in the presence of ATP. This kinetic tuning is accomplished by increasing several of the rates preceding strong binding to actin and concomitantly prolonging the duration of the strongly bound state by slowing the rate of ADP release. The net result is a myosin unlike any previously characterized, in that ADP release is the rate-limiting step for the actin-activated ATPase cycle. Thus, because of a number of kinetic adaptations, myosin V is tuned for processive movement on actin and will be capable of transporting cargo at lower motor densities than any other characterized myosin.

19805038|t|The transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3 control alternative pathways of T-cell differentiation through a shared set of target genes.
19805038|a|Upon detection of antigen, CD4(+) T helper (Th) cells can differentiate into a number of effector types that tailor the immune response to different pathogens. Alternative Th1 and Th2 cell fates are specified by the transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3, respectively. Only a handful of target genes are known for these two factors and because of this, the mechanism through which T-bet and GATA-3 induce differentiation toward alternative cell fates is not fully understood. Here, we provide a genomic map of T-bet and GATA-3 binding in primary human T cells and identify their target genes, most of which are previously unknown. In Th1 cells, T-bet associates with genes of diverse function, including those with roles in transcriptional regulation, chemotaxis and adhesion. GATA-3 occupies genes in both Th1 and Th2 cells and, unexpectedly, shares a large proportion of targets with T-bet. Re-complementation of T-bet alters the expression of these genes in a manner that mirrors their differential expression between Th1 and Th2 lineages. These data show that the choice between Th1 and Th2 lineage commitment is the result of the opposing action of T-bet and GATA-3 at a shared set of target genes and may provide a general paradigm for the interaction of lineage-specifying transcription factors.

12623970|t|The kidney, hypertension, and obesity.
12623970|a|This paper provides a personal perspective of the role of abnormal renal-pressure natriuresis in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Direct support for a major role of renal-pressure natriuresis in long-term control of arterial pressure and sodium balance comes from studies demonstrating that (1) pressure natriuresis is impaired in all forms of chronic hypertension and (2) prevention of pressure natriuresis from operating, by servo-control of renal perfusion pressure, also prevents the maintenance of sodium balance hypertension. Although the precise mechanisms of impaired pressure natriuresis in essential hypertension have remained elusive, recent evidence suggests that obesity and overweight may play a major role. Obesity increases renal sodium reabsorption and impairs pressure natriuresis by activation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems and by altered intrarenal physical forces. Chronic obesity also causes marked structural changes in the kidneys that eventually lead to a loss of nephron function, further increases in arterial pressure, and severe renal injury in some cases. Although there are many unanswered questions about the mechanisms of obesity hypertension and renal disease, this is one of the most promising areas for future research, especially in view of the growing, worldwide "epidemic" of obesity.

11035798|t|Phosphorylation of murine p53 at ser-18 regulates the p53 responses to DNA damage.
11035798|a|Ser-15 of human p53 (corresponding to Ser-18 of mouse p53) is phosphorylated by ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) family kinases in response to ionizing radiation (IR) and UV light. To determine the effects of phosphorylation of endogenous murine p53 at Ser-18 on biological responses to DNA damage, we introduced a missense mutation (Ser-18 to Ala) by homologous recombination into both alleles of the endogenous p53 gene in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Our analyses showed that phosphorylation of murine p53 at Ser-18 in response to IR or UV radiation was required for a full p53-mediated response to these DNA damage-inducing agents. In contrast, phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-18 was not required for ATM-dependent cellular resistance after exposure to IR. Additionally, efficient acetylation of the C terminus of p53 in response to DNA damage did not require phosphorylation of murine p53 at Ser-18.

11035797|t|PERK mediates cell-cycle exit during the mammalian unfolded protein response.
11035797|a|The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR)-signaling pathway. The UPR coordinates the induction of ER chaperones with decreased protein synthesis and growth arrest in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Three ER transmembrane protein kinases (Ire1alpha, Ire1beta, and PERK) have been implicated as proximal effectors of the mammalian UPR. We now demonstrate that activation of PERK signals the loss of cyclin D1 during the UPR, culminating in cell-cycle arrest. Overexpression of wild-type PERK inhibited cyclin D1 synthesis in the absence of ER stress, thereby inducing a G(1) phase arrest. PERK expression was associated with increased phosphorylation of the translation elongation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha), an event previously shown to block cyclin D1 translation. Conversely, a truncated form of PERK lacking its kinase domain acted as a dominant negative when overexpressed in cells, attenuating both cyclin D1 loss and cell-cycle arrest during the UPR without compromising induction of ER chaperones. These data demonstrate that PERK serves as a critical effector of UPR-induced growth arrest, linking stress in the ER to control of cell-cycle progression.

18253102|t|Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in the first 3 years of life.
18253102|a|Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a class of neurodevelopmental disorders defined by qualitative impairments in social functioning and communication, often accompanied by repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior and interests. The term 'ASD' encompasses autism, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, and Asperger's syndrome. ASDs show etiologic heterogeneity, and there is no definitive medical test or cure for these conditions. Around 1 in 150 children have an ASD, with males being affected three to four times more frequently than females. The age at diagnosis of ASD ranges from 3 to 6 years, but there is increasing evidence that diagnosis in the second year of life is possible in some children. Early diagnosis will lead to earlier behavior-based intervention, which is associated with improvements in core areas, such as social functioning and communication. Early detection of-and intervention to treat-ASD is crucial because it is likely to lead to an improved outcome.

16043127|t|Allosteric modulation of ligand-gated ion channels.
16043127|a|Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) are cell surface proteins that play an important role in fast synaptic transmission and in the modulation of cellular activity. Due to their intrinsic properties, LGICs respond to neurotransmitters and other effectors (e.g. pH) and transduce the binding of a ligand into an electrical current on a microsecond timescale. Following activation, LGICs open allowing an ion flux across the cell membrane. Depending upon the charge and concentration of ions, the flux can cause a depolarization or hyperpolarization, thus modulating excitability of the cell. While our understanding of LGICs has significantly progressed during the past decade, many properties of these proteins are still poorly understood, in particular their modulation by allosteric effectors. LGICs are often thought as a simple on-off switches. However, a closer look at these receptors reveals a complex behavior and a wide repertoire of subtle modulation by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. From a physiological point of view, this modulation can be seen as an additional level of complexity in the cell signaling process. Here we review the allosteric modulation of LGICs in light of the latest findings and discuss the suitability of this approach to the design of new therapeutic molecules.

11981223|t|Acute behavioral and physiological effects of modafinil in drug abusers.
11981223|a|Modafinil, a novel stimulant, is effective in the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. It is biochemically and pharmacologically distinct from prototypical stimulants such as D-amphetamine, cocaine, and methylphenidate. The present experiment was designed to assess the acute behavioral effects of oral modafinil, cocaine, and placebo in participants (n=9) with recent histories of cocaine use (i.e. positive urine for cocaine or benzoylecgonine during the initial screening interview). Drug effects were assessed with a battery of self-reported drug-effect questionnaires, performance measures, and physiological indices. Cocaine, but not modafinil, produced stimulant-like self-reported drug effects (e.g. increased ratings of High and Stimulated). Modafinil and cocaine dose-dependently increased heart rate and blood pressure. The results of the present study suggest that modafinil has minimal abuse potential, but should be viewed cautiously because of the relatively small sample size. Future studies should further characterize the abuse potential of modafinil using other behavioral arrangements, such as drug discrimination or drug self-administration. A full characterization of the abuse potential of modafinil will become important as the use of this drug increases.

7557869|t|Intrahepatic mast cells in chronic liver diseases.
7557869|a|Mast cells are known to be present in human liver but their distribution and density in normal livers and in chronic liver diseases have not previously been examined. In this study, we quantified mast cell numbers and examined their distribution in percutaneous biopsy specimens from normal livers (n = 8) and in two chronic progressive liver diseases: primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) (n = 40) and alcoholic liver disease (n = 33). We compared differences in mast cell density between these two forms of chronic liver disease because it had been suggested that mast cells may play a role in the development of liver fibrosis, particularly in patients with chronic cholestatic liver disease who frequently have increased plasma histamine levels. Mast cells were identified by immunohistochemistry using a specific monoclonal antibody (AA1) raised against mast cell tryptase after an initial study showed this to be more sensitive for the detection of mast cells than the conventional histochemical stain, toluidine blue. Our results showed that small numbers of mast cells (3.9 +/- 3.3/mm2) are present within the portal tracts and sinusoids of normal livers. In progressive chronic liver disease, increased numbers of mast cells were present, which correlated with the increasing amounts of liver fibrosis present. We found significantly more mast cells in the PBC group compared with the alcoholic group for a given amount of fibrosis. Our findings suggest that mast cells and their mediators may play a role in liver fibrogenesis.

21090928|t|Aging and hypertension.
21090928|a|Aging is known to be a dominant risk factor in the progression of hypertension. Thus, accompanied by an increasing mean age of the population in developed countries, prevention and management of hypertension in the elderly is a task of pressing urgency. Age-associated blood pressure elevation is a result of the aging process in organ systems, which play a key role in the regulation of blood pressure. In addition, advanced aging of the cardiovascular system contributes to the presence of a varied phenotype in elderly hypertension, such as nocturnal hypertension and morning hypertension. Therefore, in order to detect and treat age-associated hypertension appropriately, it is important to assess ambulatory blood pressure monitoring throughout the 24-h period.

18535489|t|Potential role of glucocorticoid signaling in the formation of pancreatic islets in the human fetus.
18535489|a|Glucocorticoids have been suggested to play a role in programming late adult disorders like diabetes during fetal life. Recent work in rodents showed their role in pancreas development by modulating the expression of transcription factors. The aim of this work was to investigate their possible implication in human pancreas development. The ontogenesis of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and several pancreatic transcription factors was studied by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR on human fetal pancreatic specimens. At 6 wk of development (wd) insulin promoting factor 1 (IPF1) was expressed in the majority of epithelial cells forming tubular structures while GR was present in the mesenchyme, suggesting an early role of glucocorticoids, before endocrine and exocrine differentiation. Only GR alpha (active form) mRNA was expressed from 6 wk onwards while GR beta (inactive form) was never observed. The first insulin cells did not express IPF1 or GR. Islet formation occurred from 10 wd as IPF1-positive cells started to express simultaneously insulin and GR. This coexpression in beta cells persisted until adulthood. The mRNA expression profiles confirmed immunohistochemistry and showed the early expression of crucial transcription factors. In conclusion, the presence of the active GR isoform around islet formation supports the novel idea that glucocorticoids could modulate human pancreas development.

9122261|t|A surface on the G protein beta-subunit involved in interactions with adenylyl cyclases.
9122261|a|Receptor activation of heterotrimeric G proteins dissociates G alpha from the G betagamma complex, allowing both to regulate effectors. Little is known about the effector-interaction regions of G betagamma. We had used molecular modeling to dock a peptide encoding the region of residues 956-982 of adenylyl cyclase (AC) 2 onto Gbeta to identify residues on Gbeta that may interact with effectors. Based on predictions from the model, we synthesized peptides encoding sequences of residues 86-105 (Gbeta 86-105) and 115-135 (Gbeta 115-135) from Gbeta. The Gbeta 86-105 peptide inhibited G betagamma stimulation of AC2 and blocked G betagamma inhibition of AC1 and by itself inhibited calmodulin-stimulated AC1, thus displaying partial agonist activity. Substitution of Met-101 with Asn in this peptide resulted in the loss of both the inhibitory and partial agonist activities. Most activities of the Gbeta 115-135 peptide were similar to those of Gbeta 86-105 but Gbeta 115-135 was less efficacious in blocking G betagamma inhibition of AC1. Substitution of Tyr-124 with Val in the Gbeta 115-135 peptide diminished all of its activities. These results identify the region encoded by amino acids 84-143 of Gbeta as a surface that is involved in transmitting signals to effectors.

18469533|t|USP22, an hSAGA subunit and potential cancer stem cell marker, reverses the polycomb-catalyzed ubiquitylation of histone H2A.
18469533|a|Initial studies of the mammalian hSAGA transcriptional coactivator complex identified the acetyltransferase hGCN5/PCAF as the only known enzymatic subunit. Recently we demonstrated that the ubiquitin hydrolase USP22 comprises a second enzymatic subunit of hSAGA, and that is required for activator-driven transcription. USP22 is expressed with polycomb ubiquitin ligases in an 11 gene signature that defines therapy-resistant tumors. At the biochemical level, these Polycomb proteins function as global transcriptional repressors by catalyzing the ubiquitylation of histone H2A. In yeast, the USP22 homolog functions as a transcriptional coactivator by removing ubiquitin from a distinct core histones, H2B. Given that USP22 is expressed in cancer as part of an 11 gene signature that includes transcriptional repressors which ubiquitylate H2A, it seemed possible that USP22 might activate transcription in part via the deubiquitylation of this same substrate. As reported here, biochemical analysis of the substrate specificity of USP22 reveals that it deubiquitylates histone H2A in addition to H2B. This finding supports a model in which the H2A ubiquitin hydrolase USP22 is coordinately expressed with Polycomb H2A ubiquitin ligases in order that the transcription of certain critical transforming genes be maintained in the face of the global repression mediated by Polycomb.

11415943|t|Rapid reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria in endothelial cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor-alpha is mediated by ceramide.
11415943|a|Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in tumor cells and hepatocytes. However, whether TNF-alpha stimulates mitochondrial ROS production in endothelial cells (EC) has not yet been reported. We studied the effect of TNF-alpha on mitochondrial ROS generation in EC and the signaling pathways involved. Cultured human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) were studied by fluorescence microscopy, using dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) as a marker of ROS production and propidium iodide uptake for cell viability. TNF-alpha increased DCFH oxidation in HUVEC dose-dependently. To determine the source of ROS, the mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors rotenone + thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), which inhibit electron entry to ubiquinone, and antimycin A (AA), a blocker of ubisemiquinone, were used. Rotenone and TTFA inhibited (n = 7, P < 0.05), whereas AA increased (118% in 3 min; n = 4, P < 0.01) ROS generation in HUVEC. In contrast, ROS production was not abolished by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium, by the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol, nor by the nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase pathway inhibitors N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine and mefenamic acid. In addition, TNF-alpha-induced ROS production was inhibited by the acidic sphingomyelinase inhibitor desipramine (5 microM; -80%, n = 4, P < 0.01) and totally blocked by the ceramide-activated protein kinase (CAPK) inhibitor dimethylaminopurine (1 mM; n = 6, P < 0.05). Thus, TNF-alpha induces mitochondrial ROS production in HUVEC that primarily occurs at the ubisemiquinone site and is mediated by ceramide-dependent signaling pathways involving CAPK.

17308033|t|Analogs of methyllycaconitine as novel noncompetitive inhibitors of nicotinic receptors: pharmacological characterization, computational modeling, and pharmacophore development.
17308033|a|As a novel approach to drug discovery involving neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), our laboratory targeted nonagonist binding sites (i.e., noncompetitive binding sites, negative allosteric binding sites) located on nAChRs. Cultured bovine adrenal cells were used as neuronal models to investigate interactions of 67 analogs of methyllycaconitine (MLA) on native alpha3beta4* nAChRs. The availability of large numbers of structurally related molecules presents a unique opportunity for the development of pharmacophore models for noncompetitive binding sites. Our MLA analogs inhibited nicotine-mediated functional activation of both native and recombinant alpha3beta4* nAChRs with a wide range of IC(50) values (0.9-115 microM). These analogs had little or no inhibitory effects on agonist binding to native or recombinant nAChRs, supporting noncompetitive inhibitory activity. Based on these data, two highly predictive 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship (comparative molecular field analysis and comparative molecular similarity index analysis) models were generated. These computational models were successfully validated and provided insights into the molecular interactions of MLA analogs with nAChRs. In addition, a pharmacophore model was constructed to analyze and visualize the binding requirements to the analog binding site. The pharmacophore model was subsequently applied to search structurally diverse molecular databases to prospectively identify novel inhibitors. The rapid identification of eight molecules from database mining and our successful demonstration of in vitro inhibitory activity support the utility of these computational models as novel tools for the efficient retrieval of inhibitors. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of computational modeling and pharmacophore development, which may lead to the identification of new therapeutic drugs that target novel sites on nAChRs.

17308038|t|The novel alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist N-[(3R)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-7-[2-(methoxy)phenyl]-1-benzofuran-2-carboxamide improves working and recognition memory in rodents.
17308038|a|The relative contribution of alpha4beta2, alpha7 and other nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes to the memory enhancing versus the addictive effects of nicotine is the subject of ongoing debate. In the present study, we characterized the pharmacological and behavioral properties of the alpha7 nAChR agonist N-[(3R)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-7-[2-(methoxy)phenyl]-1-benzofuran-2-carboxamide (ABBF). ABBF bound to alpha7 nAChR in rat brain membranes (Ki=62 nM) and to recombinant human 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)3 receptors (Ki=60 nM). ABBF was a potent agonist at the recombinant rat and human alpha7 nAChR expressed in Xenopus oocytes, but it did not show agonist activity at other nAChR subtypes. ABBF acted as an antagonist of the 5-HT3 receptor and alpha3beta4, alpha4beta2, and muscle nAChRs (at higher concentrations). ABBF improved social recognition memory in rats (0.3-1 mg/kg p.o.). This improvement was blocked by intracerebroventricular administration of the alpha7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine at 10 microg, indicating that it is mediated by alpha7 nAChR agonism. In addition, ABBF improved working memory of aged rats in a water maze repeated acquisition paradigm (1 mg/kg p.o.) and object recognition memory in mice (0.3-1 mg/kg p.o.). Rats trained to discriminate nicotine (0.4 mg/kg s.c.) from vehicle did not generalize to ABBF (0.3-30 mg/kg p.o.), suggesting that the nicotine cue is not mediated by the alpha7 nAChR and that selective alpha7 nAChR agonists may not share the abuse liability of nicotine. Our results support the hypothesis that alpha7 nAChR agonists may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cognitive deficits with low abuse potential.

6928683|t|Characterization of double-stranded-RNA-activated kinase that phosphorylates alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2 alpha) in reticulocyte lysates.
6928683|a|Incubation of reticulocyte lysates with low levels of double-stranded (ds) RNA (1-20 ng/ml) activates a cAMP-independent protein kinase (dsI) that phosphorylates the alpha-subunit (M(r) 38,000) of initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) and produces an inhibition of protein chain initiation similar to that caused by heme deficiency. Activation of dsI from its latent precursor takes place on the ribosomes and requires ATP. dsI can also be activated in ribosomal salt washes and in partially purified preparations of the latent precursor of dsI. In all preparations, activation is accompanied by the ds RNA-dependent phosphorylation of a polypeptide doublet that migrates as bands of 67 and 68.5 kilodaltons (67/68.5) in NaDodSO(4)/acrylamide gels. The rate of phosphorylation of these components in a ribosome salt wash is more rapid than the ds RNA-dependent phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha. Other polypeptides in the salt wash also undergo ds RNA-dependent phosphorylation, but their significance is not clear. All of these phosphorylations are prevented by high concentrations of poly(I).poly(C)(20 mug/ml), but not by an antiserum specific for the heme-regulated eIF-2alpha kinase. Both the latent and activated forms of dsI have been partially purified from a 0.5 M KCl wash of reticulocyte ribosomes. The two species have similar M(r)s ( approximately 120,000) and sedimentation coefficients ( approximately 3.75 S), which suggests that activation of dsI probably does not involve extensive changes. By comparison, the heme-regulated eIF-2alpha kinase has an M(r) of approximately 160,000 and sediments at approximately 6.6 S. However, in vitro, dsI and HRI both phosphorylate the same site(s) of eIF-2alpha. Purified dsI inhibits protein synthesis in hemin-supplemented lysates with the same kinetics induced by the addition of ds RNA; both inhibitions are reversed by eIF-2. dsI that has been activated in the salt wash and then purified does not require ds RNA for expression and no longer displays phosphorylation of the 68.5/67 doublet, which appears to occur only during activation. The data support the view that this component(s) may be the eIF-2alpha kinase activated by ds RNA.

10390403|t|Increased 8-isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress, in exhaled condensate of asthma patients.
10390403|a|Oxidative stress has an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. 8-Isoprostane is a prostaglandin (PG)-F2-like compound belonging to the F2 isoprostane class that is produced in vivo by the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid. 8-Isoprostane is a biomarker of oxidative stress, and its concentration is increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with interstitial lung diseases. We measured 8-isoprostane concentrations in exhaled breath condensate in healthy subjects and in patients with mild (steroid naive, n = 12), moderate (inhaled steroid treatment, n = 17), and severe asthma (oral steroid treatment, n = 15). We also measured exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO), which may also reflect oxidative stress in the airways. 8-Isoprostane was detectable in breath condensate of normal subjects (15.8 +/- 1.6 pg/ml), and was increased in the breath condensate of patients with mild (33.7 +/- 2.8, p < 0.001), moderate (38.3 +/- 3.7 pg/ml, p < 0. 001), and severe asthma (48.9 +/- 5.0 pg/ml, p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation (r = 0.68, p < 0.05) of 8-isoprostane with NO, but not with CO, in the exhaled air of patients with mild asthma, but not in that of patients with moderate or severe asthma. There was no correlation between 8-isoprostane and lung function tests in any group of patients. Our study shows that oxidative stress is increased in asthmatic subjects as reflected by 8-isoprostane concentrations in breath condensate.

12738030|t|Induction of CYP3A4 by 1alpha,25-dyhydroxyvitamin D3 in HepG2 cells.
12738030|a|CYP3A4, the predominant cytochrome P450 (CYP) expressed in human liver, contributes to the metabolism of approximately half the drugs in use today. In general, human-derived cell lines fail to express CYPs. It was previously shown that CYP3A4 mRNA and CYP3A immunoreactive protein are induced by 1alpha,25-dyhydroxyvitamin D(3) (1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3)) in the human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2. The aim of the present study was to examine whether 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) regulates CYP3A4 gene expression in HepG2 cells, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line. Treatment with 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) resulted in an induction of CYP3A4 mRNA and CYP3A4 immunoreactive protein, 1.5-fold and 4.0-fold respectively, when compared to control cultures, in a time-dependent fashion. These observations are in agreement with previous reports suggesting a role of 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) on CYP3A4 transcription regulation, and demonstrate that this hormone, as in Caco-2 cells, increase CYP3A4 levels in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, HepG2 cell cultures treated with 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3), provides a useful model to study the function of CYP3A4 and its role in drug liver metabolism.

21876144|a|The respirasome is a multisubunit supercomplex of the respiratory chain in mitochondria. Here we report the 3D reconstruction of the bovine heart respirasome, composed of dimeric complex III and single copies of complex I and IV, at about 2.2-nm resolution, determined by cryoelectron tomography and subvolume averaging. Fitting of X-ray structures of single complexes I, III(2), and IV with high fidelity allows interpretation of the model at the level of secondary structures and shows how the individual complexes interact within the respirasome. Surprisingly, the distance between cytochrome c binding sites of complexes III(2) and IV is about 10 nm. Modeling indicates a loose interaction between the three complexes and provides evidence that lipids are gluing them at the interfaces.

17266680|t|Inhibition of mRNA translation extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans.
17266680|a|Protein synthesis is a regulated cellular process that links nutrients in the environment to organismal growth and development. Here we examine the role of genes that regulate mRNA translation in determining growth, reproduction, stress resistance and lifespan. Translational control of protein synthesis by regulators such as the cap-binding complex and S6 kinase play an important role during growth. We observe that inhibition of various genes in the translation initiation complex including ifg-1, the worm homologue of eIF4G, which is a scaffold protein in the cap-binding complex; and rsks-1, the worm homologue of S6 kinase, results in lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans. Inhibition of ifg-1 or rsks-1 also slows development, reduces fecundity and increases resistance to starvation. A reduction in ifg-1 expression in dauers was also observed, suggesting an inhibition of protein translation during the dauer state. Thus, mRNA translation exerts pleiotropic effects on growth, reproduction, stress resistance and lifespan in C. elegans.

15563461|t|Trypanosome cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 2B binds cAMP through its GAF-A domain.
15563461|a|Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans and livestock, expresses at least three cAMP-specific class I phosphodiesterases (PDEs), all of which are essential for survival of the parasite. These PDEs have either one or two N-terminal GAF domains, which in other proteins function as signaling domains. However, neither the functional roles nor ligands for these domains in trypanosome PDEs are known. The present study shows that TbPDE2B, which contains two tandem GAF domains, binds cAMP with high affinity through its GAF-A domain. A purified recombinant N terminus + GAF-A domain binds cAMP with an affinity (Ki) of approximately 16 nM. It also binds cGMP but with a 15-fold lower affinity of approximately 275 nM. The TbPDE2B holoenzyme has a somewhat lower affinity (approximately 55 nM) for cAMP but a greatly lower affinity (approximately 10 microM) for cGMP. This suggests that both the selectivity and affinity for a ligand can be determined not only by the nature of the binding domain but also by the adjacent domains. Additionally, binding of cAMP to the holoenzyme showed positive cooperativity, with a Hill coefficient value of 1.75. However, binding of cGMP to the holoenzyme did not show any cooperativity, suggesting differences in the conformational changes caused by binding of these two cyclic nucleotides with the protein. Point mutation of a key predicted binding site residue (T317A) resulted in a complete loss of high affinity cAMP binding. This mutation increased the apparent Km of the mutant enzyme for substrate without altering the Vmax. A truncated catalytic domain construct of TbPDE2B also exhibited an increased Km, strongly suggesting that cAMP binding to the GAF-A domain can regulate TbPDE2B by allowing the full activity of the enzyme to be expressed. These properties of the GAF-A domain of TbPDE2B thus suggest that it could be a new target for anti-trypanosomal drugs.

15563469|t|The molecular mechanisms of coactivator utilization in ligand-dependent transactivation by the androgen receptor.
15563469|a|Androgens drive sex differentiation, bone and muscle development, and promote growth of hormone-dependent cancers by binding the nuclear androgen receptor (AR), which recruits coactivators to responsive genes. Most nuclear receptors recruit steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) to their ligand binding domain (LBD) using a leucine-rich motif (LXXLL). AR is believed to recruit unique coactivators to its LBD using an aromatic-rich motif (FXXLF) while recruiting SRCs to its N-terminal domain (NTD) through an alternate mechanism. Here, we report that the AR-LBD interacts with both FXXLF motifs and a subset of LXXLL motifs and that contacts with these LXXLL motifs are both necessary and sufficient for SRC-mediated AR regulation of transcription. Crystal structures of the activated AR in complex with both recruitment motifs reveal that side chains unique to the AR-LBD rearrange to bind either the bulky FXXLF motifs or the more compact LXXLL motifs and that AR utilizes subsidiary contacts with LXXLL flanking sequences to discriminate between LXXLL motifs.

15273402|t|Q-PCR in combination with ChIP assays to detect changes in chromatin acetylation.
15273402|a|Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) allows for the accurate and reproducible determination of the amount of target DNA in a sample through the measurement of PCR product accumulation in "real time." This method determines starting target DNA quantity over a large assay dynamic range and requires no post-PCR sample manipulation. When used in combination with the method of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), the amount of protein binding to a specific region of DNA can be accurately and rapidly determined. A method for quantifying the presence of acetylated histones H3 and H4 on different regions of a target locus using Q-PCR after ChIP is described.

16603397|t|Prolonged rapamycin treatment inhibits mTORC2 assembly and Akt/PKB.
16603397|a|The drug rapamycin has important uses in oncology, cardiology, and transplantation medicine, but its clinically relevant molecular effects are not understood. When bound to FKBP12, rapamycin interacts with and inhibits the kinase activity of a multiprotein complex composed of mTOR, mLST8, and raptor (mTORC1). The distinct complex of mTOR, mLST8, and rictor (mTORC2) does not interact with FKBP12-rapamycin and is not thought to be rapamycin sensitive. mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates Akt/PKB, a key regulator of cell survival. Here we show that rapamycin inhibits the assembly of mTORC2 and that, in many cell types, prolonged rapamycin treatment reduces the levels of mTORC2 below those needed to maintain Akt/PKB signaling. The proapoptotic and antitumor effects of rapamycin are suppressed in cells expressing an Akt/PKB mutant that is rapamycin resistant. Our work describes an unforeseen mechanism of action for rapamycin that suggests it can be used to inhibit Akt/PKB in certain cell types.

19318547|t|MUC1-induced transcriptional programs associated with tumorigenesis predict outcome in breast and lung cancer.
19318547|a|The Mucin 1 (MUC1) oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed in diverse human malignancies including breast and lung cancer. Although MUC1 modulates the activity of several transcription factors, there is no information regarding the effects of MUC1 on global gene expression patterns and the potential role of MUC1-induced genes in predicting outcome for cancer patients. We have developed an experimental model of MUC1-induced transformation that has identified the activation of gene families involved in oncogenesis, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. A set of experimentally derived MUC1-induced genes associated with tumorigenesis was applied to the analysis of breast and lung adenocarcinoma cancer databases. A 35-gene MUC1-induced tumorigenesis signature predicts significant decreases in both disease-free and overall survival in patients with breast (n=295) and lung (n=442) cancers. The data show that the MUC1 oncoprotein contributes to the regulation of genes that are highly predictive of clinical outcome in breast and lung cancer patients.

3214710|t|Chronic seizures and collateral sprouting of dentate mossy fibers after kainic acid treatment in rats.
3214710|a|Kainic acid (KA) injections destroy hippocampal pyramidal cells, induce recurrent collateral sprouting of the hilar mossy fibers (MFs), and lead to chronic seizures. In the present study, rats were injected systemically with KA (14 mg/kg) to determine whether the subsequent occurrence of seizures was correlated with MF sprouting, as indicated by Timm's staining of proximal dendrites. At 4 weeks, 56% of the KA-treated rats had MF sprouting in the temporal (ventral) hippocampus, and 52% had shown seizures between 10 and 28 days. Both seizures and sprouting were seen in 32% of the treated animals. While Timm's staining of MFs in the inner molecular layer was not directly correlated with seizure scores, animals which exhibited chronic seizures had significantly more sprouting than animals which did not have seizures.

2412127|t|Voltage-dependent ATP-sensitive potassium channels of skeletal muscle membrane.
2412127|a|It has been known for some years that skeletal muscle develops a high potassium permeability in conditions that produce rigor, where ATP concentrations are low and intracellular Ca2+ is high. It has seemed natural to attribute this high permeability to K channels that are opened by internal Ca2+, especially as the presence of such channels has been demonstrated in myotubes and in the transverse tubular membrane system of adult skeletal muscle. However, as we show here, the surface membrane of frog muscle contains potassium channels that open at low internal concentrations of ATP (less than 2 mM). ATP induces closing of these channels without being split, apparently holding the channels in one of a number of closed states. The channels have at least two open states whose dwell times are voltage-dependent. Surprisingly, we find that these may be the most common K channels of the surface membrane of skeletal muscle.

8862511|t|Cancer risk and oxidative DNA damage in man.
8862511|a|In living cells reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed continuously as a consequence of metabolic and other biochemical reactions as well as external factors. Some ROS have important physiological functions. Thus, antioxidant defense systems cannot provide complete protection from noxious effects of ROS. These include oxidative damage to DNA, which experimental studies in animals and in vitro have suggested are an important factor in carcinogenesis. Despite extensive repair oxidatively modified DNA is abundant in human tissues, in particular in tumors, i.e., in terms of 1-200 modified nucleosides per 10(5) intact nucleosides. The damaged nucleosides accumulate with age in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. The products of repair of these lesions are excreted into the urine in amounts corresponding to a damage rate of up to 10(4) modifications in each cell every day. The most abundant of these lesions, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), is also the most mutagenic, resulting in GT transversions which are frequently found in tumor relevant genes. A series of other oxidative modifications of base and sugar residues occur frequently in DNA, but they are less well studied and their biological significance less apparent. The biomarkers for study of oxidative DNA damage in humans include urinary excretion of oxidized nucleosides and bases as repair products and modifications in DNA isolated from target tissue or surrogate cells, such as lymphocytes. These biomarkers reflect the rate of damage and the balance between the damage and repair rate, respectively. By means of biomarkers a number of important factors have been studied in humans. Ionizing radiation, a carcinogenic and pure source of ROS, induced both urinary and leukocyte biomarkers of oxidative DNA damage. Tobacco smoking, another carcinogenic source of ROS, increased the oxidative DNA damage rate by 35-50% estimated from the urinary excretion of 8-oxodG, and the level of 8-oxodG in leukocytes by 20-50%. The main endogenous source of ROS, the oxygen consumption, showed a close correlation with the 8-oxodG excretion rate although moderate exercise appeared to have no immediate effect. So far, cross-sectional study of diet composition and intervention studies, including energy restriction and antioxidant supplements, have generally failed to show an influence on the oxidative DNA modification. However, a diet rich of Brussels sprouts reduced the oxidative DNA damage rate, estimated by the urinary excretion of 8-oxodG, and the intake of vitamin C was a determinant for the level of 8-oxodG in sperm DNA. A low-fat diet reduced another marker of oxidative DNA damage in leukocytes. In patients with diseases associated with a mechanistically based increased risk of cancer, including Fanconi anemia, chronic hepatitis, cystic fibrosis, and various autoimmune diseases, the biomarker studies indicate an increased rate of oxidative DNA damage or in some instances deficient repair. Human studies support the experimentally based notion of oxidative DNA damage as an important mutagenic and apparently carcinogenic factor. However, the proof of a causal relationship in humans is still lacking. This could possibly be supported by demonstration of the rate of oxidative DNA damage as an independent risk factor for cancer in a prospective study of biobank material using a nested case control design. In addition, oxidative damage may be important for the aging process, particularly with respect to mitochondrial DNA and the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.

8102159|t|Microglial cell cytotoxicity of oligodendrocytes is mediated through nitric oxide.
8102159|a|Rat ameboid microglia are able to lyse rat oligodendrocytes in vitro. The lysis is inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta, antagonists of nitric oxide (NO) production, as well as antibodies to TNF-alpha, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and leukocyte functional Ag-1. Ameboid microglial cells spontaneously produce detectable levels of the NO metabolite nitrite (NO2-). Stimuli such as PMA, LPS, and/or IFN-gamma induce micromolar concentrations of NO2- within 24 h. TNF-alpha increases IFN gamma but not LPS-induced NO2- production. Incubation with target oligodendrocytes also increases NO2- production in a contact-dependent manner. NO2- production is inhibited by NO synthase antagonists, transforming growth factor-beta, and anti TNF-alpha. Neither antileukocyte functional Ag-1 nor anti-ICAM-1 inhibit NO2- production by microglia in the presence or absence of oligodendrocytes. Indeed, anti-ICAM-1 treatment increases NO2- production. There is a correlation between ameboid microglial cell killing of oligodendrocytes and NO2- production suggesting NO may be a mechanism of death of the oligodendrocyte and possibly play a role in lesion formation in multiple sclerosis.

9679985|t|Retinoic acid induced mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase-dependent MAP kinase activation needed to elicit HL-60 cell differentiation and growth arrest.
9679985|a|Retinoic acid (RA) activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) of HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells before causing myeloid differentiation and cell cycle arrest associated with hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein. ERK2 activation by mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (MEK) was necessary for RA-induced differentiation in studies using PD98059 to block MEK phosphorylation. G0 growth arrest and RB tumor suppressor protein hypophosphorylation (which is typically associated with induced differentiation and G0 arrest), two putatively RB-regulated processes, also depended on ERK2 activation by MEK. Activation of ERK2 by RA occurred within hours and persisted until the onset of RB hypophosphorylation, differentiation, and arrest. ERK2 activation was probably needed early, because delaying the addition of PD98059 relative to that of RA restored most of the RA-induced cellular response. In contrast to RA (which activates RA receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors in HL-60 cells with its metabolite retinoids), a retinoid that selectively binds RAR-gamma, which is not expressed in HL-60 cells, was relatively ineffective in causing ERK2 activation. This is consistent with the need for a nuclear retinoid receptor function in RA-induced ERK2 activation. RA reduced the amount of unphosphorylated RAR-alpha, whose activation is necessary for RA-induced differentiation and arrest. This shifted the ratio of phosphorylated:unphosphorylated RAR-alpha to predominantly the phosphorylated form. Unlike other steroid thyroid hormone receptors susceptible to phosphorylation and activation by MAPKs, RAR-alpha was not phosphorylated by the activated ERK2 MAPK. The results thus show that RA augments MEK-dependent ERK2 activation that is needed for subsequent RB hypophosphorylation, cell differentiation, and G0 arrest. The process seems to be nuclear receptor dependent and an early seminal component of RA signaling causing differentiation and growth arrest.

15299926|t|Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.
15299926|a|This paper reviews the mathematical basis of maximum likelihood. The likelihood function for macromolecular structures is extended to include prior phase information and experimental standard uncertainties. The assumption that different parts of a structure might have different errors is considered. A method for estimating sigma(A) using 'free' reflections is described and its effects analysed. The derived equations have been implemented in the program REFMAC. This has been tested on several proteins at different stages of refinement (bacterial alpha-amylase, cytochrome c', cross-linked insulin and oligopeptide binding protein). The results derived using the maximum-likelihood residual are consistently better than those obtained from least-squares refinement.

19926617|t|Role of a novel bile acid receptor TGR5 in the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
19926617|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mechanisms of the progression from Barrett's oesophagus to oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OA) are not fully understood. Bile acids may have an important role in this progression. This study aimed at examining the role of NADPH oxidase NOX5-S and a novel bile acid receptor TGR5 in taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA)-induced increase in cell proliferation. METHODS: Human Barrett's cell line BAR-T and OA cell line FLO were transfected by the Lipofectamine 2000 or Amaxa-Nucleofector-System. mRNAs were measured by real-time PCR. H(2)O(2) was measured by a fluorescent assay. Cell proliferation was determined by measurement of thymidine incorporation. RESULTS: NOX5-S was present in FLO cells. TDCA significantly increased NOX5-S expression, H(2)O(2) production and thymidine incorporation in FLO and BAR-T cells. This increase in thymidine incorporation was significantly reduced by knockdown of NOX5-S. TGR5 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in OA tissues than in normal oesophageal mucosa or Barrett's mucosa. Knockdown of TGR5 markedly inhibited TDCA-induced increase in NOX5-S expression, H(2)O(2) production and thymidine incorporation in FLO and BAR-T cells. Overexpression of TGR5 significantly enhanced the effects of TDCA in FLO cells. TGR5 receptors were coupled with Galphaq and Galphai3 proteins, but only Galphaq mediated TDCA-induced increase in NOX5-S expression, H(2)O(2) production and thymidine incorporation in FLO cells. CONCLUSIONS: TDCA-induced increase in cell proliferation depends on upregulation of NOX5-S expression in BAR-T and FLO cells. TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression may be mediated by activation of the TGR5 receptor and Galphaq protein. These data may provide potential targets to prevent and/or treat Barrett's OA.

18255194|t|Identification by machine vision of the rate of motor activity decline as a lifespan predictor in C. elegans.
18255194|a|One challenge in aging research concerns identifying physiological parameters or biomarkers that can reflect the physical health of an animal and predict its lifespan. In C. elegans, a model organism widely used in aging research, motor deficits develop in old worms. Here we employed machine vision to quantify worm locomotion behavior throughout lifespan. We confirm that aging worms undergo a progressive decline in motor activity, beginning in early life. Importantly, the rate of motor activity decline rather than the absolute motor activity in the early-to-mid life of individual worms in an isogenic population inversely correlates with their lifespan, and thus may serve as a lifespan predictor. Long-lived mutant strains with deficits in insulin/IGF-1 signaling or food intake display a reduction in the rate of motor activity decline, suggesting that this parameter might also be used for across-strain comparison of healthspan. Our work identifies an endogenous physiological parameter for lifespan prediction and healthspan comparison.

17305786|t|Decreased high-molecular-weight adiponectin in gestational diabetes: implications for the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes.
17305786|a|AIMS: Low serum concentrations of the insulin-sensitizing protein adiponectin predict the development of incident Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). It has recently emerged that the anti-diabetic activity of adiponectin may be mediated by its high-molecular-weight (HMW) isoform, circulating levels of which are decreased in T2DM. The relevance of decreased HMW adiponectin to incident T2DM, however, has not been assessed. Since gestational diabetes (GDM) identifies a population of young women at high risk of future T2DM (i.e. representing an early stage in the natural history of the disease), we sought to determine if decreased HMW adiponectin is a feature of GDM. METHODS: HMW and total adiponectin were measured in 121 women at the time of oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) in late pregnancy, following an abnormal glucose challenge test. Based on the OGTT, there were 41 women with and 80 without GDM. RESULTS: Median HMW adiponectin concentration was lower in women with GDM (3.5 microg/ml) than in those without GDM (5.5 microg/ml) (P < 0.0001). After full adjustment for covariates, mean HMW adiponectin remained significantly lower in women with GDM compared with their peers (3.6 vs. 5.3 microg/ml, P = 0.0035). HMW adiponectin was positively associated with insulin sensitivity (IS(OGTT)) (r = 0.38, P < 0.0001) and pancreatic B-cell function [insulin secretion-sensitivity index (ISSI)] (r = 0.33, P = 0.0002) and inversely related to blood glucose levels, including area-under-the-glucose-curve during the OGTT (AUC(glucose)) (r = -0.31, P = 0.0007). On separate multiple linear regression analyses, HMW adiponectin emerged as an independent determinant of AUC(glucose), IS(OGTT) and ISSI, respectively, mirroring the relationships of total adiponectin. CONCLUSIONS: HMW adiponectin is significantly decreased in women with GDM. Deficiency of HMW adiponectin may be an early event in the natural history of T2DM.

10085079|t|Isolation and expression of novel human glutamate carboxypeptidases with N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase and dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity.
10085079|a|Hydrolysis of the neuropeptide N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate (NAAG) by N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase (NAALADase) to release glutamate may be important in a number of neurodegenerative disorders in which excitotoxic mechanisms are implicated. The gene coding for human prostate-specific membrane antigen, a marker of prostatic carcinomas, and its rat homologue glutamate carboxypeptidase II have recently been shown to possess such NAALADase activity. In contrast, a closely related member of this gene family, rat ileal 100-kDa protein, possesses a dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity. Here, we describe the cloning of human ileal 100-kDa protein, which we have called a NAALADase- "like" (NAALADase L) peptidase based on its sequence similarity to other members of this gene family, and its inability to hydrolyze NAAG in transient transfection experiments. Furthermore, we describe the cloning of a third novel member of this gene family, NAALADase II, which codes for a type II integral membrane protein and which we have localized to chromosome 11 by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. Transient transfection of NAALADase II cDNA confers both NAALADase and dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity to COS cells. Expression studies using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot hybridization show that NAALADase II is highly expressed in ovary and testis as well as within discrete brain areas.

10438630|t|Folding pathway of FKBP12 and characterisation of the transition state.
10438630|a|The folding pathway of human FKBP12, a 12 kDa FK506-binding protein (immunophilin), has been characterised. Unfolding and refolding rate constants have been determined over a wide range of denaturant concentrations and data are shown to fit to a two-state model of folding in which only the denatured and native states are significantly populated, even in the absence of denaturant. This simple model for folding, in which no intermediate states are significantly populated, is further supported from stopped-flow circular dichroism experiments in which no fast "burst" phases are observed. FKBP12, with 107 residues, is the largest protein to date which folds with simple two-state kinetics in water (kF=4 s(-1)at 25 degrees C). The topological crossing of two loops in FKBP12, a structural element suggested to cause kinetic traps during folding, seems to have little effect on the folding pathway. The transition state for folding has been characterised by a series of experiments on wild-type FKBP12. Information on the thermodynamic nature of, the solvent accessibility of, and secondary structure in, the transition state was obtained from experiments measuring the unfolding and refolding rate constants as a function of temperature, denaturant concentration and trifluoroethanol concentration. In addition, unfolding and refolding studies in the presence of ligand provided information on the structure of the ligand-binding pocket in the transition state. The data suggest a compact transition state relative to the unfolded state with some 70 % of the surface area buried. The ligand-binding site, which is formed mainly by two loops, is largely unstructured in the transition state. The trifluoroethanol experiments suggest that the alpha-helix may be formed in the transition state. These results are compared with results from protein engineering studies and molecular dynamics simulations (see the accompanying paper).
