16246080|t|Single amino acid exchanges in FAD-binding domains of squalene epoxidase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae lead to either loss of functionality or terbinafine sensitivity.
16246080|a|Squalene epoxidase (Erg1p) is an essential enzyme in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway in yeast. For its enzymatic activity, Erg1p requires molecular oxygen, NAD(P)H and FAD. Amino acid analysis and sequence alignment with other squalene epoxidases revealed two highly conserved FAD-binding domains, FAD I and FAD II. By random PCR mutagenesis of the ERG1 gene, one erg1 allele was isolated that carries a mutation leading to a single amino acid exchange in the FAD I domain close to the N-terminus of Erg1p. This erg1 allele codes for functional squalene epoxidase and renders yeast cells hypersensitive to terbinafine. Amino acid exchanges of other conserved residues in the FAD I and FAD II regions either led to non-functional squalene epoxidase or to the formation of squalene epoxidase with wild-type properties. These results describe the importance of specific amino acids for enzymatic activity in the yeast squalene epoxidase Erg1p.

17634418|t|The alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist UK 14,304 inhibits secretin-stimulated ductal secretion by downregulation of the cAMP system in bile duct-ligated rats.
17634418|a|Secretin stimulates ductal secretion by activation of cAMP --> PKA --> CFTR --> Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger in cholangiocytes. We evaluated the expression of alpha(2A)-, alpha(2B)-, and alpha(2C)-adrenergic receptors in cholangiocytes and the effects of the selective alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist UK 14,304, on basal and secretin-stimulated ductal secretion. In normal rats, we evaluated the effect of UK 14,304 on bile and bicarbonate secretion. In bile duct-ligated (BDL) rats, we evaluated the effect of UK 14,304 on basal and secretin-stimulated 1) bile and bicarbonate secretion; 2) duct secretion in intrahepatic bile duct units (IBDU) in the absence or presence of 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA), an inhibitor of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform NHE3; and 3) cAMP levels, PKA activity, Cl(-) efflux, and Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger activity in purified cholangiocytes. alpha(2)-Adrenergic receptors were expressed by all cholangiocytes in normal and BDL liver sections. UK 14,304 did not change bile and bicarbonate secretion of normal rats. In BDL rats, UK 14,304 inhibited secretin-stimulated 1) bile and bicarbonate secretion, 2) expansion of IBDU luminal spaces, and 3) cAMP levels, PKA activity, Cl(-) efflux, and Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger activity in cholangiocytes. There was decreased lumen size after removal of secretin in IBDU pretreated with UK 14,304. In IBDU pretreated with EIPA, there was no significant decrease in luminal space after removal of secretin in either the absence or presence of UK 14,304. The inhibitory effect of UK 14,304 on ductal secretion is not mediated by the apical cholangiocyte NHE3. alpha(2)-Adrenergic receptors play a role in counterregulating enhanced ductal secretion associated with cholangiocyte proliferation in chronic cholestatic liver diseases.

12235273|t|Role of the nitric oxide pathway in kappa-opioid-induced hypothermia in rats.
12235273|a|The effect of central and peripheral administration of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), on the hypothermia induced by the selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist trans-(+/-)3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2-[1-pyrrolidinyl]-cyclohexyl)-benzeneacetamide methane sulfate (U50,488H) was studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats. In the first series of experiments, we examined the effect of subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of L-NAME on the hypothermia induced by s.c. injection of U50,488H. L-NAME, at a dose of 50 mg/kg s.c., had no influence on body temperature (Tb). Coadministration of L-NAME (50 mg/kg, s.c.) with U50,488H (10 mg/kg, s.c.) blocked the hypothermia induced by U50,488H. In the second series of experiments, we investigated the effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of L-NAME on the hypothermia induced by s.c. injection of U50,488H. L-NAME itself, given i.c.v. at a dose of 1 mg/rat, did not evoke any change in Tb. Administration of L-NAME (1 mg/rat, i.c.v.) caused a significant suppression of U50,488H hypothermia. The results indicate that either central or peripheral nitric oxide synthesis is required for the production of hypothermia induced by U50,488H.

10874566|t|A pharmacological review of selective oestrogen receptor modulators.
10874566|a|Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are structurally diverse non-steroidal compounds that bind to oestrogen receptors and produce oestrogen agonist effects in some tissues and oestrogen antagonist effects in others. SERMs are being evaluated for a number of oestrogen-related diseases, including post-menopausal osteoporosis, hormone-dependent cancers, and cardiovascular disease. Several compounds that exhibit a SERM profile are currently available for clinical use, including clomiphene, tamoxifen, and toremifene (which are triphenylethylenes) and raloxifene (a benzothiophene). Clomiphene is used for the induction of ovulation in sub-fertile women attempting pregnancy. Tamoxifen and toremifene are both used to treat breast cancer. Tamoxifen may have beneficial effects on bone mineral density and serum lipids. The effects of toremifene on serum lipids are similar to that of tamoxifen. Both compounds have stimulatory effects on the endometrium. Raloxifene, indicated for the treatment and prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis, has beneficial effects on bone mineral density and serum lipids, but does not increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer. Recently, raloxifene was shown to reduce the incidence of vertebral fractures in otherwise healthy women with osteoporosis; in the same study, a reduced incidence of breast cancer was also observed. Similar to oestrogens, SERMs increase the incidence of venous thromboembolism. Several newer compounds that exhibit a SERM profile are also in clinical development, including other triphenylethylenes (droloxifene, idoxifene) and benzothiophenes (LY353381.HCl), benzopyrans (EM-800), and naphthalenes (CP-336,156).

27301751|t|Blocking inhibition of prothrombinase by tissue factor pathway inhibitor alpha: a procoagulant property of heparins.
27301751|a|Unfractionated heparin (UFH) has procoagulant activity in antithrombin/heparin cofactor II (HCII)-depleted plasma. UFH prevents tissue factor pathway inhibitor alpha (TFPIa) from inhibiting the procoagulant enzyme complex, prothrombinase, providing a possible mechanism for its procoagulant activity. The procoagulant potential of UFH and various low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) were characterized for TFPIa dependence, using thrombin generation assays performed with antithrombin/HCII-depleted plasma. UFH, the LMWHs enoxaparin and dalteparin, and the low anticoagulant LMWH 2-O, 3-O desulphated heparin (ODSH) all promoted thrombin generation, but fondaparinux did not, and this activity was blocked by a TFPIa antibody. UFH, enoxaparin, and dalteparin were anticoagulant in reactions containing 1-2% normal plasma. In prothrombinase activity assays, UFH, enoxaparin, dalteparin and ODSH blocked prothrombinase inhibition by TFPIa, while again fondaparinux did not. In both the plasma and purified assays, LMWHs displayed greater procoagulant potential than UFH, even when normalized to saccharide concentration. These biochemical data reveal that UFH and LMWHs, but not fondaparinux, block prothrombinase inhibition by TFPIa, thereby producing their paradoxical procoagulant activity observed in the absence of antithrombin/HCII. The findings may help to understand the complex pathophysiology and treatment of patients that are simultaneously bleeding and clotting, such as those with disseminated intravascular coagulation.

17681673|t|2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin modulates functional differentiation of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells Downregulation of RelB by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.
17681673|a|We have previously shown that benzo(a)pyrene inhibits the growth and functional differentiation of mouse bone marrow (BM)-derived dendritic cells (DCs) [Hwang, J.A., Lee, J.A., Cheong, S.W., Youn, H.J., Park, J.H., 2007. Benzo(a)pyrene inhibits growth and functional differentiation of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Downregulation of RelB and eIF3 p170 by benzo(a)pyrene. Toxicol. Lett. 169, 82-90]. Since the toxic effects of benzo(a)pyrene are aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent, we examined the effects of the very potent AhR agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on the growth and functional differentiation of mouse BM-derived DCs. Ten nanomolars of TCDD had significant effects on functional differentiation of mouse DCs derived from BM cultured in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4. The yields of DCs, flow-cytometrically analyzed for co-expression of CD11c/MHCII or CD11c/CD86, were reduced for TCDD-treated cultures, but TCDD itself had no effect on the growth of BM. DCs from TCDD-treated cultures expressed higher levels of MHCII and CD86, whereas expression of CD11c was reduced, compared with vehicle-treated cultures. Production of IL-10, but not IL-12, by the DCs from TCDD-treated cultures was decreased. Allogeneic T-cell stimulating ability of TCDD-treated DCs was increased compared to control DCs. The effects of TCDD were dependent on aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), because alpha-naphthoflavone, an AhR antagonist, suppressed the effects of TCDD on IL-10 production and T-cell stimulating ability. RT-PCR revealed the downregulation of RelB, a transcription factor necessary for DCs differentiation and function. Taken together, although benzo(a)pyrene and TCDD exert their effects via binding to AhR, their effects on the growth and functional differentiation of bone marrow-derived DCs are different.

11159736|t|Growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in colorectal tumor cells by cyclooxygenase inhibitors.
11159736|a|Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis and prevent or revert the growth of premalignant colonic polyps. They inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) but recent data indicate that this is not the only or even the most important mechanism of inhibition in colorectal tumor cells. We have used colonic carcinoma and adenoma cell lines to study the effects of the NSAID sulindac sulfide, its COX-inactive metabolite, sulindac sulfone, and the isoenzyme-specific inhibitors SC58125, SC236 and SC58560 on tumor cell growth in relation to COX-2 expression and prostaglandin production. To establish the role of COX-2 in NSAID action, we constructed clones expressing different levels of COX-2 from SW480 cells. All five compounds inhibited DNA synthesis and/or induced apoptosis, each with a characteristic pattern. ID(50)s were very similar in all the cell lines and were independent of COX expression, except for the COX-1 inhibitor SC58560, which was least effective in HT29/HI1, the cell line expressing the highest level of COX-1 (ID(50) 70 microM; in other cells lines the ID(50) was 15 microM). For all other compounds ID(50) concentrations varied less than two-fold: 25-40, 40-90 and 150 microM for SC236, sulindac sulfide and sulindac sulfone, respectively. SC58125 was the weakest inhibitor, never causing >50% cell loss. All compounds modulated expression of Bcl-2 and Bak and activated caspase 3. Overexpression of COX-2 in SW480 cells protected them against induction of apoptosis by sulindac sulfide. The effect was restricted to clones producing high levels of prostaglandin E(2). In summary, our data indicate that both COX-dependent and COX-independent mechanisms are involved in NSAID-induced growth in colorectal tumor cells. The concentrations necessary to inhibit growth were higher than serum concentrations that can be obtained in vivo, indicating that the therapeutic effect of NSAIDs cannot be explained by a direct effect of NSAIDs on the epithelial cells alone. For therapeutic purposes, compounds using different targets could be used to minimize side effects while optimizing therapeutic effect.

7643617|t|Molecular analysis of 13 cases of MLL/11q23 secondary acute leukemia and identification of topoisomerase II consensus-binding sequences near the chromosomal breakpoint of a secondary leukemia with the t(4;11).
7643617|a|Rearrangements of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) gene in the human 11q23 cytogenetic locus have been detected in secondary (therapy-related) acute leukemias in patients who have received topoisomerase II inhibitors for prior, independent neoplasms. The topoisomerase II inhibitors implicated in MLL/11q23 secondary leukemias all inhibit the religation step of reaction catalyzed by topoisomerase II. This results in the stabilization of a 'cleavable complex' with double-strand DNA breaks at the point of topoisomerase II binding. This raises the possibility that the cleavable complex participates in the translocation process in MLL/11q23 secondary leukemias. Here we report that the MLL/11q23 breakpoints in 13/13 patients with secondary leukemia map to the same breakpoint cluster region (bcr) noted in de novo MLL/11q23 acute leukemias and the presence of in vivo topoisomerase II inhibitor-induced cleavage sites in MLL/11q23 bcr. We have also cloned and sequenced the breakpoint from a MLL/11q23 secondary acute leukemia. This analysis revealed sequences similar to the consensus sequence for vertebrate topoisomerase II binding and cleavage close to the 11q23 and 4q21 breakpoints. These results support a role for topoisomerase II in mechanism generating translocations in MLL/11q23 secondary acute leukemia.

17931700|t|In vitro production of bovine embryos in medium supplemented with a serum replacer: effects on blastocyst development, cryotolerance and survival to term.
17931700|a|In this study, we evaluated a serum replacer (SR; Knockout SR, Invitrogen) in our in vitro culture systems. We hypothesized that SR would benefit bovine embryo development, since SR supported survival of embryonic stem cells (which originate from embryos). Experiment 1 compared oocyte maturation with SR versus fetal bovine serum (FBS). Following fertilization, blastocyst development was lower for oocytes matured with SR (21.5 versus 34.1, P<0.05). Experiment 2 evaluated SR for culturing embryos. Following fertilization, embryos were cultured for 3 days in KSOM, and then assigned to treatments: (1) KSOM static culture (KNM); (2) fresh KSOM (KD3); (3) KSOM+SR or (4) KSOM+FBS and cultured to Day 7 (fertilization=Day 0). Blastocyst development in FBS or SR was higher than either KNM or KD3 (48.2, 47.2, 32.7, and 35.5, respectively, P<0.05). Experiment 3 evaluated cryosurvival of embryos cultured in the same manner as Experiment 2. On Day 7, embryos were vitrified and upon warming, embryos cultured in SR had greater 24h survival rates (70.6%) than all other treatments (P<0.05). Finally, Experiment 4 evaluated effects of SR on pregnancy rate and development to term. Culture in SR was not detrimental to pregnancy or calving rates (50 and 50%, respectively), and SR calves had normal birth weights (mean=38.8 kg+/-1.5). In conclusion, the use of SR for maturation of oocytes was not beneficial; however, SR enhanced embryo culture by improving development in vitro, cryotolerance and survival, effectively replacing serum in culture.

10097917|t|Impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. What best predicts future diabetes in Mauritius?
10097917|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine if impaired fasting glucose (IFG; fasting plasma glucose level 6.1-6.9 mmol/l) can predict future type 2 diabetes as accurately as does impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; 2-h plasma glucose level 7.8-11.0 mmol/l). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A longitudinal population-based study was performed with surveys in 1987 and 1992 on the island of Mauritius, assessing diabetes status by the oral glucose tolerance test. A total of 3,717 subjects took part in both surveys. Of these subjects, 3,229 were not diabetic in 1987 and formed the basis of this study. RESULTS: At baseline, there were 607 subjects with IGT and 266 subjects with IFG. There were 297 subjects who developed diabetes by 1992. For predicting progression to type 2 diabetes, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values were 26, 94, and 29% for IFG and 50, 84, and 24% for IGT, respectively. Only 26% of subjects that progressed to type 2 diabetes were predicted by their IFG values, but a further 35% could be identified by also considering IGT. The sensitivities were 24% for IFG and 37% for IGT in men and 26% for IFG and 66% for IGT in women, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the higher sensitivity of IGT over IFG for predicting progression to type 2 diabetes. Screening by the criteria for IFG alone would identify fewer people who subsequently progress to type 2 diabetes than would the oral glucose tolerance test.

9041474|t|PLA2 activity in Tetrahymena pyriformis. Effects of inhibitors and stimulators.
9041474|a|Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is an enzyme which participates in signalling mechanisms cleaving arachidonate from sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids. In this study we have verified the existence of a PLA2-like activity in the free living protozoan, Tetrahymena pyriformis GL. This activity is Ca(2+)-independent, EDTA (10 mM) has no effect on its activity. Quinacrine (0.1 mM) and 4-bromophenacyl bromide (BPB; 0.1 mM) inhibited, melittin (20 micrograms/ml) significantly stimulated the PLA2 activity and the release of free arachidonic acid (AA) from 1-acyl 2-14C-arachidonyl-3-phosphatidylethanolamine substrate. Melittin stimulated PLA2 hyperactivity is CA(2+)-dependent. There was no considerable alteration in the PLA2 activity by stimulation of the activity by tyrosine kinase (with vanadate, H2O2), phospholipase C (PLC) (with phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate) or G-proteins (with NaF, AlF4), thus in Tetrahymena PLA2 activity seems to be independent of these--in Tetrahymena (also functioning)--signalling pathways. Treatment with quinacrine and BPB leads to decreased synthesis and disturbed breakdown of phospholipids and phosphoinositides. These findings suggest that PLA2 activity is in connection with the phospholipid metabolism of Tetrahymena.

25453233|t|Activation of phenylalanine hydroxylase by phenylalanine does not require binding in the active site.
25453233|a|Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheH), a liver enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of excess phenylalanine in the diet to tyrosine, is activated by phenylalanine. The lack of activity at low levels of phenylalanine has been attributed to the N-terminus of the protein's regulatory domain acting as an inhibitory peptide by blocking substrate access to the active site. The location of the site at which phenylalanine binds to activate the enzyme is unknown, and both the active site in the catalytic domain and a separate site in the N-terminal regulatory domain have been proposed. Binding of catecholamines to the active-site iron was used to probe the accessibility of the active site. Removal of the regulatory domain increases the rate constants for association of several catecholamines with the wild-type enzyme by    2-fold. Binding of phenylalanine in the active site is effectively abolished by mutating the active-site residue Arg270 to lysine. The kcat/Kphe value is down 10(4) for the mutant enzyme, and the Km value for phenylalanine for the mutant enzyme is >0.5 M. Incubation of the R270K enzyme with phenylalanine also results in a 2-fold increase in the rate constants for catecholamine binding. The change in the tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum seen in the wild-type enzyme upon activation by phenylalanine is also seen with the R270K mutant enzyme in the presence of phenylalanine. Both results establish that activation of PheH by phenylalanine does not require binding of the amino acid in the active site. This is consistent with a separate allosteric site, likely in the regulatory domain.

15749826|t|X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis functions as ubiquitin ligase toward mature caspase-9 and cytosolic Smac/DIABLO.
15749826|a|Members of the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) family function as anti-apoptotic proteins by binding directly to caspase-3, -7, and -9 to inhibit their activities. During apoptosis, the activities of IAPs are relieved by a second mitochondria-derived caspase activator, named Smac/DIABLO. Some IAPs have a C-terminal RING finger domain that has been identified as the essential motif for the activity of ubiquitin ligase (E3). Here we show that X-linked IAP (XIAP) mediates the polyubiquitination of caspase-9 and Smac. The large subunit of mature caspase-9 was polyubiquitinated by XIAP in vitro, while procaspase-9 was not. Furthermore, the polyubiquitinated form of caspase-9 accumulated in an XIAP-dependent manner in intact cells. The ubiquitination of caspase-9 was significantly inhibited in the presence of mature Smac, whereas XIAP was also found to promote the polyubiquitination of cytosolic Smac both in vitro and in intact cells. These ubiquitination reactions require the RING finger domain of XIAP. These findings suggest that XIAP functions as ubiquitin ligase toward mature caspase-9 and Smac to inhibit apoptosis.

10097918|t|Racial and ethnic differences in glycemic control of adults with type 2 diabetes.
10097918|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate glycemic control in a representative sample of U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey included national samples of non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans aged > or = 20 years. Information on medical history and treatment of diabetes was obtained to determine those who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by a physician before the survey (n = 1,480). Fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c were measured, and the frequencies of sociodemographic and clinical variables related to glycemic control were determined. RESULTS: A higher proportion of non-Hispanic blacks were treated with insulin and a higher proportion of Mexican Americans were treated with oral agents compared with non-Hispanic whites, but the majority of adults in each racial or ethnic group (71-83%) used pharmacologic treatment for diabetes. Use of multiple daily insulin injections was more common in whites. Blood glucose self-monitoring was less common in Mexican Americans, but most patients had never self-monitored. HbA1c values in the nondiabetic range were found in 26% of non-Hispanic whites, 17% of non-Hispanic blacks, and 20% of Mexican Americans. Poor glycemic control (HbA1c > 8%) was more common in non-Hispanic black women (50%) and Mexican-American men (45%) compared with the other groups (35-38%), but HbA1c for both sexes and for all racial and ethnic groups was substantially higher than normal levels. Those with HbA1c > 8% included 52% of insulin-treated patients and 42% of those taking oral agents. There was no relationship of glycemic control to socioeconomic status or access to medical care in any racial or ethnic group. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that many patients with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. have poor glycemic control, placing them at high risk of diabetic complications. Non-Hispanic black women, Mexican-American men, and patients treated with insulin and oral agents were disproportionately represented among those in poor glycemic control. Clinical, public health, and research efforts should focus on more effective methods to control blood glucose in patients with diabetes.

2871961|t|Esmolol hydrochloride: an ultrashort-acting, beta-adrenergic blocking agent.
2871961|a|The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, hemodynamic and electrophysiologic effects, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, drug interactions, compatibility and stability, dosage, and administration of esmolol hydrochloride are reviewed. Esmolol produces competitive blockade of beta receptors in both animals and humans. It does not possess membrane-stabilizing, intrinsic sympathomimetic, or alpha-adrenergic blocking activity. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol is similar to that of metoprolol. Esterase metabolism accounts for the rapid total body clearance of 285 mL/kg/min and elimination half-life of 9.2 minutes. Its rapid metabolism following continuous intravenous infusion results in the rapid offset of pharmacologic effect after drug administration is discontinued. In patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, esmolol produces rapid control of heart rate in an average effective dosage range from 97.2 to 115.0 micrograms/kg/min and effects that are similar to propranolol. Esmolol is effective and safe in managing tachycardia and hypertension during surgical stress and may be useful in postoperative hypertension or elevated heart rates during myocardial ischemia. Esmolol does not appear to interact with digoxin, morphine, warfarin, or succinylcholine to any clinically important extent. The most frequent adverse effects associated with esmolol infusion are hypotension and phlebitis. Hypotension can be avoided by careful titration, and if encountered, it can be rapidly resolved by dosage adjustment or discontinuation of the infusion. The ultrashort half-life and duration of action of esmolol may allow safer application of beta blockade in critically ill patients.

18642705|t|Peculiarities of the antioxidant status of the thyroid gland.
18642705|a|The intensity of lipid peroxidation and activity of the antioxidant system in the thyroid gland were compared with those in the liver, kidney, heart, and frontal lobes of the cerebral hemispheres in euthyroid male Wistar rats. The thyroid gland was characterized by low activity of first-line antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase, considerable concentration of reduced glutathione, and high activity of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. Our results suggest that the system of glutathione metabolism determines antioxidant status of the thyroid gland.

28171787|t|High-throughput NIR-chemometric methods for chemical and pharmaceutical characterization of sustained release tablets.
28171787|a|The aim of this study was the development and validation of methods based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and chemometry, useful for characterization of sustained release (SR) tablets with indapamide, in terms of tablet composition (API and two excipients), in vitro drug release mechanism (k and n Peppas) and crushing strength. A calibration set consisting of 25 different tablets formulations containing API, HPMC and lactose at five different content levels in the range 100  20% relative to a targeted tablet composition, were manufactured by direct compression in order to develop the methods for prediction of tablet composition, and in vitro drug release mechanism. On the other hand, a 15 batches calibration set prepared at five different compression forces was used for development of methods for prediction of crushing strength. Moreover, independent batches were manufactured for validation of all methods Intact tablets were analyzed by transmission mode with NIRS, the spectra were pre-processed, and partial least square (PLS) regression was used to build prediction models. Cross-validation was carried out in order to select the optimal number of PLS factors for all models, and the best model was chosen based on their RMSECV and bias. All developed methods were validated in terms of trueness, precision and accuracy. Based on the validation results, the methods proposed in this work can successfully be applied for routine determination of indapamide, HPMC and lactose content of sustained release tablets, as well as for prediction of their in vitro drug release mechanism (k and n Peppas) and crushing strength.

14604470|t|Enhancement of radiation-induced apoptosis by Podophyllum hexandrum.
14604470|a|The aqueous extract of Podophyllum hexandrum (RP-1), which has been recently reported to manifest radioprotective and anti-tumour properties, has been investigated for its mode of action. RP-1, under in-vitro conditions dose-dependently chelated metal ions, inhibited radiation or metal ion-induced hydroxyl radicals and lipid peroxidation and scavenged superoxide anions. Intraperitoneal administration of RP-1 to mice pre-irradiation (10 Gy) induced more DNA fragmentation and lipid peroxidation in thymocytes maximally at 4 and 8 h, respectively, in comparison with RP-1 treatment or irradiation. Flow-cytometric quantification of sub-diploid peak, oligonucleosomal cleavage assay (ladder) and depletion of total thiols also corroborated the ability of RP-1 to enhance radiation-induced apoptosis. RP-1 in presence of 100 microM CuSO(4) induced strand breaks in plasmid DNA and addition of metal chelators (EDTA and deferoxamine) inhibited the strand scission. Treatment with a major constituent of RP-1, podophyllin, did not cause strand breaks, but isolated constituents of RP-1, quercetin or podophyllotoxin, induced strand breaks. Depending on its concentration in the milieu, RP-1 acted as a pro- or antioxidant modifying the radiation-induced apoptosis and therefore could be exploited for cancer management.

24011957|t|A mitochondrial implication in a Tunisian patient with Friedreich's ataxia-like.
24011957|a|Genes encoding the DNA helicase TWINKLE (C10orf2) or the two subunits of mtDNA polymerase y (POLy) (POLG1 and POLG2) have a direct effect on the mitochondrial DNA replication machinery and were reported in many mitochondrial disorders. Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is the common cause of ataxia often associated with the expansion of a GAA repeat in intron 1 of the frataxin gene (FXN). Mitochondrial DNA could be considered as a candidate modi   er factor for FRDA disease, since mitochondrial oxidative stress is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. We screened the FXN, POLG1 and C10orf2 genes in a Tunisian patient with clinical features of Friedreich's ataxia-like. The results showed the absence of the expansion of a GAA triplet repeat in intron 1 of the FXN gene. Besides, the sequencing of all the exons and their flanking regions of the FXN, POLG1 and C10orf2 genes revealed the presence of intronic polymorphisms. In addition, screening of the mtDNA revealed the presence of several mitochondrial known variations and the absence of mitochondrial deletions in this patient. The detected m.16187C>T and the m.16189T>C change the order of the homopolymeric tract of cytosines between 16184 and 16193 in the mitochondrial D-loop and could lead to a mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting replication and affecting protein involved in the replication process of the mtDNA which could be responsible for the clinical features of Friedreich ataxia observed in the studied patient.

9001706|t|L-deprenyl fails to protect mesencephalic dopamine neurons and PC12 cells from the neurotoxic effect of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion.
9001706|a|L-Deprenyl, a monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor, appears to slow down the progression of Parkinson's disease. While inhibition of MAO-B activity can account for some of the effects of this substance, the basis by which L-deprenyl slows the progression of the disease remains controversial. In recent years, a new mechanism of action has emerged that may explain the ability of L-deprenyl to increase neuronal survival. L-deprenyl has been reported to modify gene expression and protein synthesis in astrocytes and PC12 cells. In this study, we tested the ability of L-deprenyl to protect mouse mesencephalic cells from the toxicity of the 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium ion (MPP+). We exposed mouse mesencephalic cell cultures to L-deprenyl (10 microM) and, 24 h later, to MPP+ (2.5 microM). On the fifth day after L-deprenyl and MPP+ exposition, cells were washed free of drugs, and the following day they were tested for dopamine uptake, intracellular dopamine content and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity. The experiments were performed either in the presence or in the absence of glia. It was found that L-deprenyl pretreatment failed to achieve any protection against MPP+ toxicity. The fall in dopamine uptake and intracellular dopamine content, and the diminution of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity observed in cells pretreated with L-deprenyl and then given MPP+ were not significantly different from the values observed in cells treated with MPP+ alone. Additional experiments performed in PC12 cells, confirmed the failure of L-deprenyl to abolish the toxicity of MPP+. Our data seem to be at variance with previous reports demonstrating that the MAO-B inhibitor L-deprenyl protects dopaminergic neurons against MPP+ toxicity [12,20]; furthermore they do not support alternative mechanisms of action of L-deprenyl against MPP+ toxicity.

9058320|a|In the presence of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), high-affinity norepinephrine (NE) uptake by quail neural crest cells was significantly increased as judged by in vitro colony assay of adrenergic differentiation. In the presence of the related neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF) or brain-derived neurotrophic (BDNF) factor, or of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), there were no significant changes. When NE was added to the culture medium in addition to NT-3, more colonies contained dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH)-immunoreactive cells, an enzyme that is characteristic for adrenergic cells. The NE-mediated increase in the portion of colonies that contained DBH-immunoreactive cells was prevented by the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (DMI) and by cocaine, two types of drug that block cellular transport of NE. To further examine whether NE acts via uptake, colony assays were performed in the presence and absence of adrenergic antagonists and agonists. These would be expected to mimic the DMI and NE effects, respectively, if the mechanism of action involved activation of adrenergic autoreceptors. Neither class of drug showed a detectable effect within a wide range of concentrations. Immunocytochemistry using antibodies against beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors further supported the notion that DMI action and beta-receptor expression are not causally related. Ratio imaging was subsequently used in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of NE action. Within a few minutes of addition of NE to the culture medium, there was an increase in intracellular free calcium in a subset of neural crest cells. Taken together, our data indicate that NT-3 is involved in the appearance of the NE transporter (NET) during embryonic development; internalized NE directly or indirectly increases adrenergic differentiation as measured by immunoreactivity of the adrenergic biosynthetic enzyme DBH; and norepinephrine uptake inhibitors have treatogenic potential.

27179975|t|Role of UCP2 in the protective effects of PPARb/   activation on lipopolysaccharide-induced endothelial dysfunction.
27179975|a|Bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates inflammatory pathways, induces cytokine expression in the endothelium, augments reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the vascular wall, and induces endothelial dysfunction. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)b/   activation on LPS-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction and to determine whether uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) plays a role in these effects. In vivo, the PPARb/   agonist GW0742 treatment prevented the LPS-induced reduction in aortic relaxation, the increase in vascular ROS production, the upregulation of NOX1, NOX2, p47(phox), and p22(phox) mRNA levels, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers in mice. We show that in mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs), GW0742 prevented the decreased A23187-stimulated nitric oxide (NO) production, and the increased intracellular ROS levels caused by exposure to LPS in vitro. The PPARb/   antagonist GSK0660 abolished all these in vivo and in vitro protective effects induced by GW0742. This agonist also restored the reduced expression of UCP2 and mitofusin-2 induced by LPS. The effects of GW0742 on NO and ROS production in MAEC exposed to LPS were abolished by the UCP2 inhibitor genipin or by siRNA targeting UCP-2. Genipin also suppressed the expressional changes on NADPH oxidase and ER stress markers induced by GW0742. In conclusion, PPARb/   activation restored the LPS-induced endothelial dysfunction by upregulation of UCP2, with the subsequent alleviation of ER stress and NADPH oxidase activity, thus reducing intracellular ROS production and increasing NO bioavailability.

28473463|t|Recessively Inherited LRBA Mutations Cause Autoimmunity Presenting as Neonatal Diabetes.
28473463|a|Young-onset autoimmune diabetes associated with additional autoimmunity usually reflects a polygenic predisposition, but rare cases result from monogenic autoimmunity. Diagnosing monogenic autoimmunity is crucial for patients' prognosis and clinical management. We sought to identify novel genetic causes of autoimmunity presenting with neonatal diabetes (NDM) (diagnosis <6 months). We performed exome sequencing in a patient with NDM and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and his unrelated, unaffected parents and identified compound heterozygous null mutations in LRBA Biallelic LRBA mutations cause common variable immunodeficiency-8; however, NDM has not been confirmed in this disorder. We sequenced LRBA in 169 additional patients with diabetes diagnosed <1 year without mutations in the 24 known NDM genes. We identified recessive null mutations in 8 additional probands, of which, 3 had NDM (<6 months). Diabetes was the presenting feature in 6 of 9 probands. Six of 17 (35%) patients born to consanguineous parents and with additional early-onset autoimmunity had recessive LRBA mutations. LRBA testing should be considered in patients with diabetes diagnosed <12 months, particularly if they have additional autoimmunity or are born to consanguineous parents. A genetic diagnosis is important as it can enable personalized therapy with abatacept, a CTLA-4 mimetic, and inform genetic counseling.

20199087|t|Development of novel, highly potent inhibitors of V-RAF murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 (BRAF): increasing cellular potency through optimization of a distal heteroaromatic group.
20199087|a|We describe the design, synthesis, and optimization of a series of new inhibitors of V-RAF murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 (BRAF), a kinase whose mutant form (V600E) is implicated in several types of cancer, with a particularly high frequency in melanoma. Our previously described inhibitors with a tripartite A-B-C system (where A is a hinge binding pyrido[4,5-b]imidazolone system, B is an aryl spacer group, and C is a heteroaromatic group) were potent against purified (V600E)BRAF in vitro but were less potent in accompanying cellular assays. Substitution of different aromatic heterocycles for the phenyl based C-ring is evaluated herein as a potential means of improving the cellular potencies of these inhibitors. Substituted pyrazoles, particularly 3-tert-butyl-1-aryl-1H-pyrazoles, increase the cellular potencies without detrimental effects on the potency on isolated (V600E)BRAF. Thus, compounds have been synthesized that inhibit, with low nanomolar concentrations, (V600E)BRAF, its downstream signaling in cells [as measured by the reduction of the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)], and the proliferation of mutant BRAF-dependent cells. Concomitant benefits are good oral bioavailability and high plasma concentrations in vivo.

8180126|t|Down-regulation of retinoic acid receptor beta in mammary carcinoma cell lines and its up-regulation in senescing normal mammary epithelial cells.
8180126|a|Retinoids are important cellular, dietary factors that regulate differentiation and cellular growth. They serve as ligands for specific nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptors (RARs). Ligand-activated receptors regulate gene transcription through target retinoic acid-responsive elements (RAREs) found in promoter regions. We have investigated the expression of retinoic acid receptor genes (alpha, beta, gamma) and retinoid X receptor beta in normal, senescing, and tumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells. We find that most tumor cells show a loss of RAR-beta expression, but that RAR-alpha and -gamma as well as retinoid X receptor beta are variably expressed in both normal and tumor cells. RAR-beta gene expression is induced both by retinoic acid and by fenretinide in normal cells, but tumor cells fail to respond to either. In contrast, RAR-beta expression increases with serial passage in senescing cells. Paradoxically, both normal and tumor cells can trans-activate an exogenous beta-RARE, as demonstrated by reporter gene assays. Oligonucleotide mobility shift assays with the beta-RARE show a single discrete complex in normal cells, whereas tumor cells exhibit a heterogeneous set of larger complexes, which indicates that tumor cells utilize a different array of factors within the beta-RARE. Reporter gene assays with extended promoter regions indicate the presence of negative regulatory elements and/or factor binding sites that reside between -1500 and the RARE located at -59, and that the promoter is down-regulated in MCF-7 tumor cells. Our findings reveal a dichotomy: RAR-beta transcription is down-regulated in tumor cells compared with normal human mammary epithelial cells, and up-regulated in senescence.

21489083|t|Body fat distribution and their associations with cardiovascular risk, insulin resistance and b-cell function: are there differences between men and women?
21489083|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the independent and gender-specific effects of WC and BMI on CVD risk factors, insulin resistance and b-cell function. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of 2931 adults aged 20-79 years was carried out in Fujian province by multi-stratified sampling from July 2007 to May 2008. Gender-specific differences of WC and BMI on CVD risk factors, insulin resistance and b-cell function were displayed jointly by WC and BMI tertiles. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index and the quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI): l/(log G0    log I0) were used to estimate insulin sensitivity; insulin secretion was assessed using the HOMA-b index; b-cell function was quantified as the ratio of the incremental insulin to glucose responses over the first 30 min during the OGTT (   I30/   G30). The oral disposition index (DIo) was calculated as /\I(30) //\G(30)   1/fasting insulin. The Matsuda index is defined as 10,000/sqrt (FBG   FPI   [G   I]) where FPG is fasting glucose, FPI is fasting insulin, G is mean glucose during the OGTT (calculated from glucose samples at 0, 30, and 120 min), and I is mean insulin during the OGTT (calculated from insulin samples at 0, 30, and 120 min). RESULTS: Waist circumference and BMI correlated with each other in both men (0.756, p < 0.001) and women (0.728, p < 0.001). The two indexes were independently associated with CVD risk factors (such as hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and dyslipidaemia) in both men and women. BMI was better than WC in assessing the risk of diabetes in men (p = 0.003 for BMI, and p = 0.234 for WC), while WC was better than BMI in predicting diabetes in women (p < 0.001 for WC, and p = 0.831 for BMI). There were significant associations between BMI and insulin resistance or b-cell function even after adjustment for WC except for DIo in male subjects, but WC only associated with HOMA-IR positively or the Matsuda index and QUICKI negatively after adjustment for BMI. For women, associations between WC and insulin resistance or b-cell function remained strong even after adjustment for BMI besides DIo. However, there were no independent relations of BMI to insulin resistance and b-cell function except for Matsuda index with a significant negative association after adjustment for WC in women. CONCLUSION: Body mass index and WC were independently associated with CVD risk factors. There were differences in the gender-specific relevance of measures of body fat distribution in assessing the insulin resistance, b-cell function and thus the risk of diabetes. Therefore, WC should be measured in addition to BMI to assess CVD risk accurately and implement efficient treatment strategies.

25947940|t|Functional role of a polymorphism in the Pannexin1 gene in collagen-induced platelet aggregation.
25947940|a|UNASSIGNED: Pannexin1 (Panx1) forms ATP channels that play a critical role in the immune response by reinforcing purinergic signal amplification in the immune synapse. Platelets express Panx1 and given the importance of ATP release in platelets, we investigated Panx1 function in platelet aggregation and the potential impact of genetic polymorphisms on Panx1 channels. We show here that Panx1 forms ATP release channels in human platelets and that inhibiting Panx1 channel function with probenecid, mefloquine or specific 10Panx1 peptides reduces collagen-induced platelet aggregation but not the response induced by arachidonic acid or ADP. These results were confirmed using Panx1-/- platelets. Natural variations have been described in the human Panx1 gene, which are predicted to induce non-conservative amino acid substitutions in its coding sequence. Healthy subjects homozygous for Panx1-400C, display enhanced platelet reactivity in response to collagen compared with those bearing the Panx1-400A allele. Conversely, the frequency of Panx1-400C homozygotes was increased among cardiovascular patients with hyper-reactive platelets compared with patients with hypo-reactive platelets. Exogenous expression of polymorphic Panx1 channels in a Panx-deficient cell line revealed increased basal and stimulated ATP release from cells transfected with Panx1-400C channels compared with Panx1-400A expressing transfectants. In conclusion, we demonstrate a specific role for Panx1 channels in the signalling pathway leading to collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Our study further identifies for the first time an association between a Panx1-400A>C genetic polymorphism and collagen-induced platelet reactivity. The Panx1-400C variant encodes for a gain-of-function channel that may adversely affect atherothrombosis by specifically enhancing collagen-induced ATP release and platelet aggregation.

10570148|t|Tyrosine replacement in P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 affects distinct kinetic and mechanical properties of bonds with P- and L-selectin.
10570148|a|Selectins are adhesion molecules that initiate tethering and rolling of leukocytes on the vessel wall. Rolling requires rapid formation and breakage of selectin-ligand bonds that must have mechanical strength to resist premature dissociation by the forces applied in shear flow. P- and L-selectin bind to the N-terminal region of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a mucin on leukocytes. To define determinants on PSGL-1 that contribute to the kinetic and mechanical properties of bonds with selectins, we compared rolling of transfected preB cells expressing P- or L-selectin on transfected cell monolayers expressing wild-type PSGL-1 or PSGL-1 constructs with substitutions in targeted N-terminal residues. Rolling through P- or L-selectin required a Thr or Ser at a specific position on PSGL-1, the attachment site for an essential O-glycan, but required only one of three nearby Tyr residues, which are sites for Tyr-SO(3) formation. The adhesive strengths and numbers of cells rolling through P- or L-selectin were similar on wild-type PSGL-1 and on each of the three PSGL-1 constructs containing only a single Tyr. However, the cells rolled more irregularly on the single-Tyr forms of PSGL-1. Analysis of the lifetimes of transient tethers on limiting densities of PSGL-1 revealed that L-selectin dissociated faster from single-Tyr than wild-type PSGL-1 at all shears examined. In sharp contrast, P-selectin dissociated faster from single-Tyr than wild-type PSGL-1 at higher shear but not at lower shear. Thus, tyrosine replacements in PSGL-1 affect distinct kinetic and mechanical properties of bonds with P- and L-selectin.

17065415|t|CREM confers cAMP responsiveness in human steroidogenic acute regulatory protein expression in NCI-H295R cells rather than SF-1/Ad4BP.
17065415|a|Steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein plays a critical role in steroid hormone synthesis. Tropic hormones induce human StAR gene expression by a cAMP-dependent pathway. Steroidogenic factor-1/adrenal-4-binding protein (SF-1/Ad4BP) plays an important role in the expression of human StAR gene. We investigated the mechanism of cAMP responsiveness in human StAR gene expression in NCI-H295R cells. The StAR promoter activity and protein levels in cells subjected to various treatments were examined. Anti-SF-1/Ad4BP IgG transfection treatment resulted in decreases in the basal StAR promoter activity and StAR protein levels, but did not affect cAMP-stimulated promoter activity and protein levels. The basal and cAMP-stimulated StAR promoter activity levels were reduced in SF-1/Ad4BP mutant (G35E)-transfected cells, but the cAMP induction of StAR promoter activity in response to 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP was not inhibited when G35E SF-1/Ad4BP mutant expression vectors were co-transfected with cAMP-response element-binding (CREB) expression vectors. Although the basal StAR mRNA expression and protein levels were decreased by SF-1/Ad4BP-siRNA treatment, the cAMP-stimulated StAR mRNA expression and protein levels did not change. The basal StAR promoter activity level was not decreased by cAMP-response element modulator (CREM)-siRNA treatment, but the cAMP-stimulated StAR promoter activity level, the magnitude of cAMP induction of StAR promoter, and the cAMP-stimulated StAR protein level were decreased. The cAMP induction of StAR promoter activity in cells was inhibited when S117ACREM mutant expressionvectors were transfected. We conclude that inhibition of the function of SF-1/Ad4BP does not reduce the cAMP induction of StAR promoter activity and protein level. CREM is needed to confer cAMP responsiveness in human StAR protein expression.

21269478|t|Vasculoprotective effects of rosiglitazone through modulating renin-angiotensin system in vivo and vitro.
21269478|a|BACKGROUND: The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-y (PPARy) agonist rosiglitazone has been suggested to exert cardiovascular protection through the improvement of lipid metabolism, anti-inflammation, anti-proliferation etc. However, whether renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the vascular protective effects of PPARy agonists is not fully understood. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the renin-angiotensin system in vascular protection mediated by PPARy agonists. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the actions of the renin-angiotensin system in vascular protection mediated by activation of PPARy in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Rats were fed a regular diet (n = 8), a cholesterol-rich diet plus methylthiouracil (80 mg/Kg/day, n = 10), a cholesterol-rich diet plus methylthiouracil and rosiglitazone (4 mg/kg/day, n = 10). The rosiglitazone treatment was started from one month after the start of cholesterol-rich diet plus methylthiouracil, and lasted five months. Cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were pretreated with 1  mol/L angiotensin II (ANG II) for 6 h and randomly divided into the control group; the ANG II group (1  mol/L ANG II); the groups respectively treated with different concentration rosiglitazone (20, 30, 50)  mol/L for 12 h; the groups treated with 30  mol/L rosiglitazone for (6, 12, 24) h. Morphology changes of the aortic tissues were observed by hematoxylin and eosin stain. The VSMC growth was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay. Angiotensin II and expression of angiotensin receptors were determined by radioimmunoassay, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: After 6 months, lipid deposition, VSMC proliferation and migration toward intima were observed in aortic tissues in the rats on a cholesterol-rich diet plus methylthiouracil, while these pathological changes induced by the cholesterol-rich diet were significantly suppressed by rosiglitazone. In addition, VSMC proliferation induced by ANG II was markedly inhibited by rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone markedly down-regulated expression of angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) and up-regulated expression of angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) in the aortic tissues and ANG II-treated VSMCs. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that PPARy agonist rosiglitazone suppressed ANG II-induced VSMC proliferation in vitro and early atherosclerotic formation evoked by cholesterol-rich diet in vivo. These vasculoprotective effects of rosiglitazone were mediated at least partially by reduction in local tissue ANG II concentration, down-regulation of AT1R expression and up-regulation of AT2R expression both at the mRNA and protein levels.

23746070|t|Spontaneously differentiated GATA6-positive human embryonic stem cells represent an important cellular step in human embryonic development; they are not just an artifact of in vitro culture.
23746070|a|In this study, we isolated and characterized spontaneously differentiated human embryonic stem cells (SD-hESCs) found in hESC colonies in comparison to the morphologically premature ESCs in the colonies to investigate the potential role of SD-hESCs in embryogenesis. SD-hESCs were distinguished from undifferentiated hESCs by their higher expression of GATA6, a marker for primitive endoderm and transthyretin, a marker visceral endoderm in embryoid bodies (EBs). SD-hESCs expressed OCT4 and NANOG, markers for pluripotent stem cells, at significantly lower levels than undifferentiated hESCs. EBs derived from isolated SD-hESCs were morphologically distinct from cells directly derived from the undifferentiated hESCs; they contained higher number of cysts compared to EBs from undifferentiated hESC-derived EBs (42% vs. 20%). Furthermore, the extracellular signal molecule, BMP2/4, induced a higher GATA4/6 expression and cystic EB formation than control and noggin-treated EBs. Since cystic formation in EBs play a role in primitive endoderm formation during embryogenesis, the SD-hESC may be a relevant cell type equipped to differentiate into primitive endoderm. Our results suggest that SD-ESCs generated during routine hESC culture are not just an artifact of in vitro culture and these cells could serve as a useful model to study the process of embryogenesis.

20371315|t|Stationary gating of GluN1/GluN2B receptors in intact membrane patches.
20371315|a|NMDA receptors are heteromeric glutamate-gated channels composed of GluN1 and GluN2 subunits. Receptor isoforms that differ in their GluN2-subunit type (A-D) are expressed differentially throughout the central nervous system and have distinct kinetic properties in recombinant systems. How specific receptor isoforms contribute to the functions generally attributed to NMDA receptors remains unknown, due in part to the incomplete functional characterization of individual receptor types and unclear molecular composition of native receptors. We examined the stationary gating kinetics of individual rat recombinant GluN1/GluN2B receptors in cell-attached patches of transiently transfected HEK293 cells and used kinetic analyses and modeling to describe the full range of this receptor's gating behaviors. We found that, like GluN1/GluN2A receptors, GluN1/GluN2B receptors have three gating modes that are distinguishable by their mean open durations. However, for GluN1/GluN2B receptors, the modes also differed markedly in their mean closed durations and thus generated a broader range of open probabilities. We also found that regardless of gating mode, glutamate dissociation occurred approximately 4-fold more slowly (k(-) = 15 s(-1)) compared to that observed in GluN1/GluN2A receptors. On the basis of these results, we suggest that slow glutamate dissociation and modal gating underlie the long heterogeneous activations of GluN1/GluN2B receptors.

20401896|t|Investigation on the second part of the electromagnetic SERS enhancement and resulting fabrication strategies of anisotropic plasmonic arrays.
20401896|a|In general, the electromagnetic mechanism is understood as the strongest contribution to the overall surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) enhancement. Due to the excitation of surface plasmons, a strong electromagnetic field is induced at the interfaces of a metallic nanoparticle leading to a drastic enhancement of the Raman scattering cross-section. Furthermore, the Raman scattered light expierences an emission enhancement due to the plasmon resonances of the nanoantennas. Herein, this second part of the electromagnetic enhancement phenomenon is investigated for different Raman bands of crystal violet by utilizing the anisotropic plasmonic character of gold nanorhomb SERS arrays. We aim at evaluating the effects of localized and propagating surface plasmon polariton modes as well as their combination on the scattered SERS intensity. From that point of view, design and fabrication strategies towards the fabrication of SERS arrays for excitation wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral region can be given, also using a double-resonant electromagnetic enhancement.

1977784|t|Antihistamines in the treatment of clinical asthma.
1977784|a|Because the older antihistamines possessed relatively weak antihistaminic action, as well as sedative and anticholinergic effects, they could not be administered in doses high enough to confer relief to atopic patients with asthma. In contrast, the newer nonsedating, more potent H1-receptor antagonists appear to achieve effective histamine blockade in patients with asthma. Terfenadine and astemizole inhibit bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled allergens by 50% in the early asthmatic reaction. High-potency antihistamines also significantly reduce cough and wheeze as compared with placebo in grass pollen-sensitive asthma patients. Significant reductions in symptom severity and bronchodilator use were found with terfenadine, 120 mg twice daily, although these improvements may be confined to younger patients. Some of the newer antihistamines have demonstrated interesting effects on the late-phase allergic response. Azelastine partially inhibits bronchoconstriction in the allergen-induced late reaction of atopic persons with asthma, possibly by suppressing the release of additional inflammatory mediators. In the skin, cetirizine has been found to reduce eosinophil and neutrophil late-phase infiltration and prostaglandin D2 release. These interesting properties now warrant further investigation in clinical studies.

20821653|t|Perfluorooctane sulfonate toxicity, isomer-specific accumulation, and maternal transfer in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).
20821653|a|Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS; C(8)F(17)SO(3) (-)) bioaccumulation and toxicity have been demonstrated in both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. The majority of investigations have examined total PFOS concentrations in wildlife and in toxicity testing, but isomer-specific monitoring studies are less common, and no laboratory-based study of PFOS isomer accumulation in fish has been reported. The present study examined accumulation and maternal transfer of PFOS isomers in zebrafish and tissue-specific accumulation of PFOS isomers in trout parr. A median lethal dose (LC50) of 22.2 and 2.5 mg/L was calculated for adult zebrafish and trout parr, respectively. A two-week PFOS exposure resulted in tissue-specific PFOS accumulation in trout, with maximum concentrations identified in the liver tissue (>50 microg/g). Prior exposure to PFOS as alevin did not affect the accumulation of PFOS in tissues later in life. In both species, accumulation of branched PFOS isomers generally occurred to a lesser extent than linear PFOS, which may explain the relative deficiency of branched PFOS isomers in some aquatic species in the field. Analysis of exposed trout tissues indicated that isomer discrimination may occur at the level of elimination or uptake and elimination processes in the kidney or gill, respectively. When zebrafish underwent a reproductive cycle in the presence of PFOS, approximately 10% (wt) of the adult PFOS body burden was transferred to the developing embryos, resulting in a higher total PFOS concentration in eggs (116 +/- 13.3 microg/g) than in the parent fish (72.1 +/- 7.6 microg/g). The isomer profile in eggs was not significantly different from that of adults, suggesting that the maternal transfer of branched and linear PFOS isomers in fish is largely nonisomer specific.

20654680|t|Nanotoxicity of pure silica mediated through oxidant generation rather than glutathione depletion in human lung epithelial cells.
20654680|a|Though, oxidative stress has been implicated in silica nanoparticles induced toxicity both in vitro and in vivo, but no similarities exist regarding dose-response relationship. This discrepancy may, partly, be due to associated impurities of trace metals that may present in varying amounts. Here, cytotoxicity and oxidative stress parameters of two sizes (10 nm and 80 nm) of pure silica nanoparticles was determined in human lung epithelial cells (A549 cells). Both sizes of silica nanoparticles induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity as measured by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. Silica nanoparticles were also found to induce oxidative stress in dose-dependent manner indicated by induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and membrane lipid peroxidation (LPO). However, both sizes of silica nanoparticles had little effect on intracellular glutathione (GSH) level and the activities of glutathione metabolizing enzymes; glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO) plus silica nanoparticles did not result in significant GSH depletion than that caused by BSO alone nor N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) afforded significant protection from ROS and LPO induced by silica nanoparticles. The rather unaltered level of GSH is also supported by finding no appreciable alteration in the level of GR and GPx. Our data suggest that the silica nanoparticles exert toxicity in A549 cells through the oxidant generation (ROS and LPO) rather than the depletion of GSH.

10950853|t|Isoform specificity of N-deacetyl ketoconazole by human and rabbit flavin-containing monooxygenases.
10950853|a|N-Deacetyl ketoconazole (DAK) is the major metabolite of orally administered ketoconazole. This major metabolite has been demonstrated to be further metabolized predominately by the flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) to the secondary hydroxylamine, N-deacetyl-N-hydroxyketoconazole (N-hydroxy-DAK) by adult and postnatal rat hepatic microsomes. Our current investigation evaluated the FMO isoform specificity of DAK in a pyrophosphate buffer (pH 8.8) containing the glucose 6-phosphate NADPH-generating system. cDNA-expressed human FMOs (FMO1, FMO3, and FMO5) and cDNA-expressed rabbit FMOs (FMO1, FMO2, FMO3, and FMO5) were used to assess the metabolism of DAK to its subsequent FMO-mediated metabolites by HPLC analysis. Human and rabbit cDNA-expressed FMO3 resulted in extensive metabolism of DAK in 1 h (71.2 and 64.5%, respectively) to N-hydroxy-DAK (48.2 and 47.7%, respectively) and two other metabolites, metabolite 1 (11.7 and 7.8%, respectively) and metabolite 3 (10.5 and 10.0%, respectively). Previous studies suggest that metabolite 1 is the nitrone formed after successive FMO-mediated metabolism of N-hydroxy-DAK. Moreover, these studies display similar metabolic profiles seen with adult and postnatal rat hepatic microsomes. The human and rabbit FMO1 metabolized DAK predominately to the N-hydroxy-DAK in 1 h (36.2 and 25.3%, respectively) with minimal metabolism to the other metabolites (</=5%). Rabbit FMO2 metabolized DAK to N-hydroxy-DAK (15.9%) and metabolite 1 (6.6%). Last, DAK did not appear to be a substrate for human or rabbit FMO5. Heat inactivation of cDNA-expressed FMOs abolished DAK metabolite formation. These results suggest that DAK is a substrate for human and rabbit FMO1 and FMO3, rabbit FMO2, but not human or rabbit FMO5.

23078950|t|A critical review of sex differences in decision-making tasks: focus on the Iowa Gambling Task.
23078950|a|It has been observed that men and women show performance differences in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a task of decision-making in which subjects through exploration learn to differentiate long-term advantageous from long-term disadvantageous decks of cards: men choose more cards from the long-term advantageous decks than women within the standard number of 100 trials. Here, we aim at discussing psychological mechanisms and neurobiological substrates underlying sex differences in IGT-like decision-making. Our review suggests that women focus on both win-loss frequencies and long-term pay-off of decks, while men focus on long-term pay-off. Furthermore, women may be more sensitive to occasional losses in the long-term advantageous decks than men. As a consequence hereof, women need 40-60 trials in addition before they reach the same level of performance as men. These performance differences are related to differences in activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as in serotonergic activity and left-right hemispheric activity. Sex differences in orbitofrontal cortex activity may be due to organisational effects of gonadal hormones early in life. The behavioural and neurobiological differences in the IGT between men and women are an expression of more general sex differences in the regulation of emotions. We discuss these findings in the context of sex differences in information processing related to evolutionary processes. Furthermore we discuss the relationship between these findings and real world decision-making.

23126661|t|Alpinia officinarum inhibits adipocyte differentiation and high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice through regulation of adipogenesis and lipogenesis.
23126661|a|Although Alpinia officinarum has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of several conditions, such as abdominal pain, emesis, diarrhea, impaired renal function, and dysentery, little is known about its function in obesity. In this study, we investigated the antiobesity effect of A. officinarum ethanol extract (AOE) on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells and obesity in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). AOE dose-dependently suppressed lipid accumulation during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by downregulating CCAAT enhancer binding protein a (C/EBPa), sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-y (PPAR-y) genes. Galangin, a major component of A. officinarum, had antiadipogenic effects in 3T3-L1 cells. AOE supplementation in mice fed a HFD revealed that AOE significantly decreased HFD-induced increases in body, liver, and white adipose tissue weights and decreased serum insulin and leptin levels. To elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of AOE in obesity, lipid metabolism-related genes were identified. AOE efficiently suppressed protein expressions of C/EBPa, fatty acid synthase, SREBP-1, and PPAR-y in the liver and adipose tissue. The protein expression patterns, observed by immunoblot, were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Collectively, these results suggest that AOE prevents obesity by suppressing adipogenic and lipogenic genes. AOE has potential for use as an antiobesity therapeutic agent that can function by regulating lipid metabolism.

26287184|t|Methyl Sartortuoate Inhibits Colon Cancer Cell Growth by Inducing Apoptosis and G2/M-Phase Arrest.
26287184|a|The potential anti-neoplastic activity of terpenoids is of continued interest. In this study, we investigate whether methyl sartortuoate, a terpenoid isolated from soft coral, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a human colon cancer cell line. Culture studies found that methyl sartortuoate inhibited colon cancer cell (LoVo and RKO) growth and caused apoptotic death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, by activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, p53 and Bax, and inactivation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) apoptosis regulating proteins. Methyl sartortuoate treatment led to reduced expression of cdc2 and up-regulated p21 and p53, suggesting that Methyl sartortuoate induced G2-M arrest through modulation of p53/p21/cdc2 pathways. Methyl sartortuoate also up-regulated phospho-JNK and phospho-p38 expression levels. This resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G2-M phase and apoptosis in LoVo and RKO cells. Treatment with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 prevented methyl sartortuoate-induced apoptosis in LoVo cells. Moreover, methyl sartortuoate also prevented neoplasm growth in NOD-SCID nude mice inoculated with LoVo cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that methyl sartortuoate is capable of leading to activation of caspase-8, -9, -3, increasing p53 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio apoptosis through MAPK-dependent apoptosis and results in G2-M phase arrest in LoVo and RKO cells. Thus, methyl sartortuoate may be a promising anticancer candidate.

16554039|t|Evaluation of ligand selectivity using reporter cell lines stably expressing estrogen receptor alpha or beta.
16554039|a|Estrogens control transcriptional responses through binding to two different nuclear receptors, estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta). Since these two ER subtypes are thought to mediate different biological effects, there is intense interest in designing subtype-selective ER ligands. In this study, we evaluated the ERalpha and ERbeta selectivity of 19 known estrogens and antiestrogens using reporter cell lines previously developed in our laboratory. The HELN-ERalpha and HELN-ERbeta cells stably express full-length ERalpha and ERbeta, respectively, and are derived from HELN cells (HeLa cells stably transfected with an ERE-driven luciferase plasmid). We report that 16alpha-LE2, PPT and 3beta,5alpha-GSD have a high ERalpha-selective agonist potency while 8beta-VE2, DPN, genistein and biochanin A show ERbeta selectivity with 8beta-VE2 being the most potent and selective ERbeta agonist. We also tested ER antagonists and we showed that raloxifene and RU486 are ERalpha and ERbeta-selective antiestrogens, respectively. In all cases, selectivity is due to differences in binding affinities as indicated by whole-cell ligand-binding assays. Very interestingly, we demonstrate that a combination of genistein and raloxifene produces a full-ERbeta specific response. Together these results demonstrate the usefulness of our stably transfected cell lines to characterize ER ligands and indicate that treatments combining agonist/antagonist ligands produce full-ERbeta selectivity.

20168047|t|Inhibition by 2-methoxy-4-ethylphenol of Ca2+ influx through acquired and native N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor channels.
20168047|a|Pharmacological properties were evaluated for the antidiarrheic wood creosote ingredient 2-methoxy-4-ethylphenol (2M4EP), which was shown to be protective against neurotoxicity of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), to modulate Ca(2+) influx across acquired and native NMDA receptor (NMDAR) channels. NMDA markedly increased intracellular free Ca(2+) levels in HEK293 cells transfected with the expression vector of either NR2A or NR2B subunit together with the essential NR1 subunit vector. Further addition of dizocilpine inhibited the increase by NMDA in intracellular Ca(2+) levels in both types of acquired NMDAR channels, while 2M4EP and the NR2B-subunit-selective antagonist ifenprodil were more effective in inhibiting the increase by NMDA in HEK293 cells expressing NR1/NR2B subunits than in those with NR1/NR2A subunits. 2M4EP significantly prevented the increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels by NMDA in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Brief exposure to NMDA led to a drastic decrease in cellular viability 24 h later in cultured hippocampal neurons, while 2M4EP significantly prevented the loss of cellular vitality by NMDA. Similarly, 2M4EP more efficiently protected HEK293 cells with NR1/NR2B subunits than those with NR1/NR2A subunits. These results suggest that 2M4EP may protect neurons from excitotoxicity through inhibition of Ca(2+) influx across NMDAR channels composed of NR1/NR2B, rather than NR1/NR2A, subunits.

24434139|t|TMPRSS4 induces cancer cell invasion through pro-uPA processing.
24434139|a|TMPRSS4 is a novel type II transmembrane serine protease that is highly expressed on the cell surface in pancreatic, thyroid, colon, and other cancer tissues. Previously, we demonstrated that TMPRSS4 mediates cancer cell invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and metastasis and that increased TMPRSS4 expression correlates with colorectal cancer progression. We also demonstrated that TMPRSS4 upregulates urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene expression to induce cancer cell invasion. However, it remains unknown how proteolytic activity of TMPRSS4 contributes to invasion. In this study, we report that TMPRSS4 directly converted inactive pro-uPA into the active form through its proteolytic activity. Analysis of conditioned medium from cells overexpressing TMPRSS4 demonstrated that the active TMPRSS4 protease domain is released from the cells and is associated with the plasma membrane. Furthermore, TMPRSS4 could increase pro-uPA-mediated invasion in a serine proteolytic activity-dependent manner. These observations suggest that TMPRSS4 is an upstream regulator of pro-uPA activation. This study provides valuable insights into the proteolytic function of TMPRSS4 as well as mechanisms for the control of invasion.

28323899|t|Lawsonia intracellularis exploits b-catenin/Wnt and Notch signalling pathways during infection of intestinal crypt to alter cell homeostasis and promote cell proliferation.
28323899|a|Lawsonia intracellularis is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes proliferative enteropathy (PE) in pigs. L. intracellularis infection causes extensive intestinal crypt cell proliferation and inhibits secretory and absorptive cell differentiation. However, the affected host upstream cellular pathways leading to PE are still unknown. b-catenin/Wnt signalling is essential in maintaining intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation and self-renewal capacity, while Notch signalling governs differentiation of secretory and absorptive lineage specification. Therefore, in this report we used immunofluorescence (IF) and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RTqPCR) to examine b-catenin/Wnt and Notch-1 signalling levels in uninfected and L. intracellularis infected pig ileums at 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days post challenge (dpc). We found that while the significant increase in Ki67+ nuclei in crypts at the peak of L. intracellularis infection suggested enhanced cell proliferation, the expression of c-MYC and ASCL2, promoters of cell growth and ISC proliferation respectively, was down-regulated. Peak infection also coincided with enhanced cytosolic and membrane-associated b-catenin staining and induction of AXIN2 and SOX9 transcripts, both encoding negative regulators of b-catenin/Wnt signalling and suggesting a potential alteration to b-catenin/Wnt signalling levels, with differential regulation of the expression of its target genes. We found that induction of HES1 and OLFM4 and the down-regulation of ATOH1 transcript levels was consistent with the increased Notch-1 signalling in crypts at the peak of infection. Interestingly, the significant down-regulation of ATOH1 transcript levels coincided with the depletion of MUC2 expression at 14 dpc, consistent with the role of ATOH1 in promoting goblet cell maturation. The lack of significant change to LGR5 transcript levels at the peak of infection suggested that the crypt hyperplasia was not due to the expansion of ISC population. Overall, simultaneous induction of Notch-1 signalling and the attenuation of b-catenin/Wnt pathway appear to be associated with the inhibition of goblet cell maturation and enhanced crypt cell proliferation at the peak of L. intracellularis infection. Moreover, the apparent differential regulation of apoptosis between crypt and lumen cells together with the strong induction of Notch-1 signalling and the enhanced SOX9 expression along crypts 14 dpc suggest an expansion of actively dividing transit amplifying and/or absorptive progenitor cells and provide a potential basis for understanding the development and maintenance of PE.

20677742|t|Free energy perturbation simulation on transition states and high-activity mutants of human butyrylcholinesterase for (-)-cocaine hydrolysis.
20677742|a|A unified computational approach based on free energy perturbation (FEP) simulations of transition states has been employed to calculate the mutation-caused shifts of the free energy change from the free enzyme to the rate-determining transition state for (-)-cocaine hydrolysis catalyzed by the currently most promising series of mutants of human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) that contain the A199S/A328W/Y332G mutations. The FEP simulations were followed by Michaelis-Menten kinetics analysis determining the individual k(cat) and K(M) values missing for the A199S/F227A/A328W/Y332G mutant in this series. The calculated mutation-caused shifts of the free energy change from the free enzyme to the rate-determining transition state are in good agreement with the experimental kinetic data, demonstrating that the unified computational approach based on the FEP simulations of the transition states may be valuable for future computational design of new BChE mutants with a further improved catalytic efficiency against (-)-cocaine.

24474557|t|Heat shock-induced dissociation of TRF2 from telomeres does not initiate a telomere-dependent DNA damage response.
24474557|a|Telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2) is a well-studied shelterin complex subunit that plays a major role in the protection of chomosome ends and the prevention of the telomere-associated DNA damage response. We show that heat shock induces the dissociation of TRF2 from telomeres in human primary and cancer cell cultures. TRF2 is not simply degraded in response to heat shock, but redistributed thoughout the nucleoplasm. This TRF2 depletion/redistribution does not initiate the DNA damage response at chomosome termini.

9049607|t|Pharmacological heterogeneity of NMDA receptors: characterization of NR1a/NR2D heteromers expressed in Xenopus oocytes.
9049607|a|The pharmacology of recombinant NR1a/NR2D NMDA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes was examined and compared to the pharmacology of NR1a/NR2A, NR1a/NR2B and NR1a/NR2C heteromers. The NR1/NR2D heteromer showed a pharmacological profile distinct from each of the other NR1/NR2 heteromers. This unique pharmacological profile was characterized by a relatively lower affinity for the agonist homoquinolinate and the antagonists 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (D-AP5) and (R,E)-4-(3-phosphonoprop-2-enyl)piperazine-2-carboxylic acid (D-CPPene) but not for the antagonists (+/-)-4-(4-phenylbenzoyl) piperazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (PBPD) and alpha-amino-5-(phosphonomethyl)[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-propanoic acid (EAB515). NR2D-containing receptors displayed a pharmacological profile most similar to that observed for receptors containing the genetically related NR2C subunit. These findings parallel observations obtained for native NMDA receptors in the medial thalamus (presumed to contain NR2D subunits) and forebrain (presumed to contain NR2A and NR2B subunits). Thus, only compounds that discriminate between either NR2A- or NR2B-containing heteromers and NR2D-containing heteromers also discriminate between forebrain and medial thalamic NMDA receptors. While the pharmacology of the NR1a/NR2D receptor shows many parallels to the medial thalamic NMDA receptor, some differences were observed. Certain compounds which discriminate between medial thalamic and cerebellar (presumed to contain NR2C subunits) receptors (e.g., homoquinolinate, D-CPPene) did not show a similar selectivity for NR1a/NR2D receptors relative to NR1/NR2C receptors. Co-expression of NR1a, NR2B and NR2D subunits in Xenopus oocytes resulted in the formation of heteromeric complexes with unique pharmacological properties, suggesting the co-existence of these two distinct NR2 subunits in the same receptor complex.

16282325|t|Distinct BIR domains of cIAP1 mediate binding to and ubiquitination of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 and second mitochondrial activator of caspases.
16282325|a|Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) regulate apoptosis primarily by inhibiting caspase-family proteases. However, many IAPs also possess E3 ligase (ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase) activities implicated in both caspase-dependent and -independent functions of these proteins. Here, we compared the structural features of cIAP1 responsible for its interactions with two known target proteins, TRAF2 and SMAC. The N-terminal (BIR1) and C-terminal (BIR3) BIR domains of cIAP1 were determined to be necessary and sufficient for binding TRAF2 and SMAC, respectively. Mutational analysis of the BIR1 and BIR3 domains identified critical residues required for TRAF2 and SMAC binding. Using these mutants, cIAP1-mediated ubiquitination of TRAF2 and SMAC in vitro was determined to be correspondingly dependent on intact binding sites on BIR1 and BIR3. Because TRAF2 regulates NF-kappaB activation, the effects of cIAP1 on TRAF2-mediated induction of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity were studied using reporter gene assays. Expression of a fragment of cIAP1 encompassing the three BIR domains (but not full-length cIAP1) greatly enhanced TRAF2-induced increases in NF-kappaB activity, providing a convenient assay for monitoring BIR-dependent effects of cIAP1 on TRAF2 in cells. BIR1 mutants of the BIR1-3 fragment of cIAP1 that failed to bind TRAF2 lost the ability to modulate NF-kappaB activity, demonstrating a requirement for BIR1-mediated interactions with TRAF2. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the modularity and diversification of BIR domains, showing that a single cIAP can direct its E3 ligase activity toward different substrates and can alter the cellular functions of different protein targets in accordance with differences in the specificity of individual BIR domains.

7044525|t|Tamoxifen versus aminoglutethimide versus combined tamoxifen and aminoglutethimide in the treatment of advanced breast carcinoma.
7044525|a|In a control randomized cross-over trial, 117 patients with advanced breast cancer were treated initially either with tamoxifen (10 mg p.o. twice daily) or aminoglutethimide (250 mg p.o. 4 times daily) with hydrocortisone (20 mg twice daily). Patients failing to respond or relapsing were switched to the alternative treatment. Eighteen (30%) of the 60 patients initially treated with tamoxifen achieved an objective response, and 11 (18%) achieved stable disease. Seventeen (30%) of the 57 patients treated initially with aminoglutethimide achieved an objective response, and 13 (23%) achieved stable disease. Aminoglutethimide achieved a 35% objective response and a further 26% subjective bone pain relief in patients with bone metastases (overall, 61%) compared with a 17% objective response and a further 17% objective bone pain relief with tamoxifen (total, 34%). None of six premenopausal patients responded to aminoglutethimide compared with two of four responding to tamoxifen. The median response duration to aminoglutethimide was 16 months compared with 20 months for tamoxifen. Side effects for aminoglutethimide (including lethargy, rash, and depression) were more common than for tamoxifen, and 7% of aminoglutethimide-treated patients had to discontinue treatment because of these compared with 0% on tamoxifen. In cross-over studies, 6 of 12 tamoxifen responders who relapsed achieved a second response to aminoglutethimide (50%), as did 6 of 29 patients who initially failed to respond to tamoxifen (21%). In contrast, none of 11 patients relapsing after response to aminoglutethimide achieved a second response to tamoxifen; only 1 of 18 nonresponders to aminoglutethimide subsequently responded to tamoxifen (6%). In a subsequent study in which 62 patients were treated with combined tamoxifen and aminoglutethimide, the overall response rate of 37% was not significantly better than that for either agent used alone.

28802681|t|Activated FGFR3 promotes bone formation via accelerating endochondral ossification in mouse model of distraction osteogenesis.
28802681|a|Achondroplasia (ACH) is one of the most common short-limbed skeletal dysplasias caused by gain-of-function mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptors 3 (FGFR3) gene. Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is a treatment option for short stature in ACH in some countries. Although the patients with ACH usually show faster healing in DO, details of the newly formed bone have not been examined. We have developed a mouse model of DO and analyzed new bone regenerates of the transgenic mice with ACH (Fgfr3ach mice) histologically and morphologically. We established two kinds of DO protocols, the short-DO consisted of 5days of latency period followed by 5days of distraction with a rate of 0.4mm per 24h, and the long-DO consisted of the same latency period followed by 7days of distraction with a rate of 0.3mm per 12h. The callus formation was evaluated radiologically by bone fill score and quantified by micro-CT scan in both protocols. The histomorphometric analysis was performed in the short-DO protocol by various stainings, including Villanueva Goldner, Safranin-O/Fast green, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and type X collagen. Bone fill scores were significantly higher in Fgfr3ach mice than in wild-type mice in both protocols. The individual bone parameters, including bone volume and bone volume/tissue volume, were also significantly higher in Fgfr3ach mice than in wild-type mice in both protocols. The numbers of osteoblasts, as well as osteoclasts, around the trabecular bone were increased in Fgfr3ach mice. Cartilaginous tissues of the distraction region rapidly disappeared in Fgfr3ach mice compared to wild-type mice during the consolidation phase. Similarly, type X collagen-positive cells were markedly decreased in Fgfr3ach mice during the same period. Fgfr3ach mice exhibited accelerated bone regeneration after DO. Accelerated endochondral ossification could contribute to faster healing in Fgfr3ach mice.

25442674|t|Distinct signaling mechanisms of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in glioblastoma multiforme: a tale of two complexes.
25442674|a|Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine-threonine kinase that functions via two multiprotein complexes, namely mTORC1 and mTORC2, each characterized by different binding partners that confer separate functions. mTORC1 function is tightly regulated by PI3-K/Akt and is sensitive to rapamycin. mTORC2 is sensitive to growth factors, not nutrients, and is associated with rapamycin-insensitivity. mTORC1 regulates protein synthesis and cell growth through downstream molecules: 4E-BP1 (also called EIF4E-BP1) and S6K. Also, mTORC2 is thought to modulate growth factor signaling by phosphorylating the C-terminal hydrophobic motif of some AGC kinases such as Akt and SGK. Recent evidence has suggested that mTORC2 may play an important role in maintenance of normal as well as cancer cells by virtue of its association with ribosomes, which may be involved in metabolic regulation of the cell. Rapamycin (sirolimus) and its analogs known as rapalogues, such as RAD001 (everolimus) and CCI-779 (temsirolimus), suppress mTOR activity through an allosteric mechanism that acts at a distance from the ATP-catalytic binding site, and are considered incomplete inhibitors. Moreover, these compounds suppress mTORC1-mediated S6K activation, thereby blocking a negative feedback loop, leading to activation of mitogenic pathways promoting cell survival and growth. Consequently, mTOR is a suitable target of therapy in cancer treatments. However, neither of these complexes is fully inhibited by the allosteric inhibitor rapamycin or its analogs. In recent years, new pharmacologic agents have been developed which can inhibit these complexes via ATP-binding mechanism, or dual inhibition of the canonical PI3-K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. These compounds include WYE-354, KU-003679, PI-103, Torin1, and Torin2, which can target both complexes or serve as a dual inhibitor for PI3-K/mTOR. This investigation describes the mechanism of action of pharmacological agents that effectively target mTORC1 and mTORC2 resulting in suppression of growth, proliferation, and migration of tumor and cancer stem cells.

17263763|t|Prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus and the effect of weight on measures of insulin secretion and insulin resistance in third-trimester pregnant rural women residing in the Central Region of Limpopo Province, South Africa.
17263763|a|AIMS: To examine the prevalence of gestational diabetes in third-trimester pregnant women as well as to assess their insulin secretion and insulin resistance (IR). METHODS: Third-trimester pregnant women (n= 262) attending antenatal care at local clinics in the central region of the Limpopo Province underwent a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with blood collected at 0, 30 and 120 min. Glucose and insulin were measured. RESULTS: The prevalence of gestational impaired glucose tolerance (GIGT) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was 8.8% (7.3% GIGT; 1.5% GDM). Women with GIGT/GDM were significantly older and had more children compared with women with a normal response to the OGTT. Homeostasis model assessment(HOMA)-IR and fasting insulin were lower in the GIGT/GDM group compared with the normal group, as were measures of insulin secretion (HOMA B-cell function and insulinogenic index). Furthermore, women with body mass index (BMI)> or =30.0 kg/m2 were significantly older and had higher parity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements than those with BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 and BMI < 25.0 kg/m2. However,increased BMI was not associated with an increased risk of GIGT/GDM. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that there is a high prevalence of GIGT/GDM, with most women having IGT. The GIGT/GDM present in these women is characterized by increased insulin sensitivity accompanied by reduced pancreatic B-cell function. Additionally, heavier women appear to have increased first phase insulin secretion, suggesting the presence of insulin resistance.

22459995|t|Endosulfan exposure inhibits brain AChE activity and impairs swimming performance in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio).
22459995|a|Endosulfan is a broad spectrum organochlorine pesticide that is still widely in use in many developing countries. Following application, endosulfan can get to watercourses through surface runoff from agricultural fields and disturb the non-target aquatic animals including freshwater fish species. Given that the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of the most recurrently used biomarkers of exposure to pesticides and there are controversial results concerning the effects of endosulfan exposure and AChE activity in fish, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of endosulfan in brain AChE activity and its gene expression pattern using adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an animal model. Moreover, we have analyzed the effects of endosulfan exposure in different parameters of zebrafish swimming activity and in long-term memory formation. After 96 h of exposition, fish in the 2.4  g endosulfan/L group presented a significant decrease in AChE activity (9.44    1.038  mol SCh h(-1) mg protein(-1); p=0.0205) when compared to the control group (15.87    1.768  mol SCh h(-1) mg protein(-1); p=0.0205) which corresponds to approximately 40%. The down-regulation of brain AChE activity is not directly related with the transcriptional control as demonstrated by the RT-qPCR analysis. Our results reinforce AChE activity inhibition as a pathway of endosulfan-induced toxicity in brain of fish species. In addition, exposure to 2.4  g endosulfan/L during 96 h impaired all exploratory parameters evaluated: decreased line crossings (   21%, 273.7    28.12 number of line crossings compared to the control group 344.6    21.30, p=0.0483), traveled distance (   20%, 23.44    2.127 m compared to the control group 29.39    1.585, p=0.0281), mean speed (   25%, 0.03    0.003 m/s compared to the control group 0.04    0.002, p=0.0275) and body turn angle (   21%, 69,940    4871 absolute turn angle compared to the control group 88,010    4560, p=0.0114). These results suggest that endosulfan exposure significantly impairs animals' exploratory performance, and potentially compromises their ecological and interspecific interaction. Our results also showed that the same endosulfan exposure did not compromise animals' performance in the inhibitory avoidance apparatus. These findings provide further evidence of the deleterious effects of endosulfan exposure in the nervous system.

22642194|t|Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors as investigative tools in the pathogenesis and management of vascular disease.
22642194|a|Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteolytic enzymes that degrade various components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). MMPs could also regulate the activity of several non-ECM bioactive substrates and consequently affect different cellular functions. Members of the MMPs family include collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, matrilysins, membrane-type MMPs, and others. Pro-MMPs are cleaved into active MMPs, which in turn act on various substrates in the ECM and on the cell surface. MMPs play an important role in the regulation of numerous physiological processes including vascular remodeling and angiogenesis. MMPs may also be involved in vascular diseases such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysm, and varicose veins. MMPs also play a role in the hemodynamic and vascular changes associated with pregnancy and preeclampsia. The role of MMPs is commonly assessed by measuring their gene expression, protein amount, and proteolytic activity using gel zymography. Because there are no specific activators of MMPs, MMP inhibitors are often used to investigate the role of MMPs in different physiologic processes and in the pathogenesis of specific diseases. MMP inhibitors include endogenous tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) and pharmacological inhibitors such as zinc chelators, doxycycline, and marimastat. MMP inhibitors have been evaluated as diagnostic and therapeutic tools in cancer, autoimmune disease, and cardiovascular disease. Although several MMP inhibitors have been synthesized and tested both experimentally and clinically, only one MMP inhibitor, i.e., doxycycline, is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This is mainly due to the undesirable side effects of MMP inhibitors especially on the musculoskeletal system. While most experimental and clinical trials of MMP inhibitors have not demonstrated significant benefits, some trials still showed promising results. With the advent of new genetic and pharmacological tools, disease-specific MMP inhibitors with fewer undesirable effects are being developed and could be useful in the management of vascular disease.

19890095|t|Dysregulation of bone remodeling by imatinib mesylate.
19890095|a|Imatinib mesylate is a rationally designed tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Although the efficacy and tolerability of imatinib are a vast improvement over conventional chemotherapies, the drug exhibits off-target effects. An unanticipated side effect of imatinib therapy is hypophosphatemia and hypocalcemia, which in part has been attributed to drug-mediated changes to renal and gastrointestinal handling of phosphate and calcium. However, emerging data suggest that imatinib also targets cells of the skeleton, stimulating the retention and sequestration of calcium and phosphate to bone, leading to decreased circulating levels of these minerals. The aim of this review is to highlight our current understanding of the mechanisms surrounding the effects of imatinib on the skeleton. In particular, it examines recent studies suggesting that imatinib has direct effects on bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts through inhibition of c-fms, c-kit, carbonic anhydrase II, and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. The potential application of imatinib in the treatment of cancer-induced osteolysis will also be discussed.

25945652|t|Modulation of insulin degrading enzyme activity and liver cell proliferation.
25945652|a|UNASSIGNED: Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM), insulin therapy, and hyperinsulinemia are independent risk factors of liver cancer. Recently, the use of a novel inhibitor of insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) was proposed as a new therapeutic strategy in T2DM. However, IDE inhibition might stimulate liver cell proliferation via increased intracellular insulin concentration. The aim of this study was to characterize effects of inhibition of IDE activity in HepG2 hepatoma cells and to analyze liver specific expression of IDE in subjects with T2DM. HepG2 cells were treated with 10  nM insulin for 24  h with or without inhibition of IDE activity using IDE RNAi, and cell transcriptome and proliferation rate were analyzed. Human liver samples (n = 22) were used for the gene expression profiling by microarrays. In HepG2 cells, IDE knockdown changed expression of genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis pathways. Proliferation rate was lower in IDE knockdown cells than in controls. Microarray analysis revealed the decrease of hepatic IDE expression in subjects with T2DM accompanied by the downregulation of the p53-dependent genes FAS and CCNG2, but not by the upregulation of proliferation markers MKI67, MCM2 and PCNA. Similar results were found in the liver microarray dataset from GEO Profiles database. In conclusion, IDE expression is decreased in liver of subjects with T2DM which is accompanied by the dysregulation of p53 pathway. Prolonged use of IDE inhibitors for T2DM treatment should be carefully tested in animal studies regarding its potential effect on hepatic tumorigenesis.

20940330|t|A tandem mass spectrometry triplex assay for the detection of Fabry, Pompe, and mucopolysaccharidosis-I (Hurler).
20940330|a|BACKGROUND: We sought to develop a tandem mass spectrometry assay in which the enzymatic activities of 3 lysosomal enzymes (a-glucosidase, a-galactosidase A, and a-l-iduronidase) could be quantified in dried blood spots by using a single assay buffer. METHODS: A 3-mm dried blood spot punch was incubated in a single assay buffer with 3 different substrates and internal standards. The sample was processed by a simple liquid-liquid extraction by using ethyl acetate. The extract was dried down and resuspended in solvent for injection into the tandem mass spectrometer. Products and internal standards were monitored by multiple reaction monitoring. RESULTS: Assay for the 3 lysosomal enzymes was successfully achieved with acceptable statistics. The assay can be performed by using a minimal quantity of disposable supplies and equipment. The entire procedure fits into a 48-h cycle including data analysis. Data from 5990 anonymous newborn dried blood spots showed an approximate bell-shaped distribution of enzymatic activities (mean values of 19.0, 11.5, and 3.5  mol    h(-1)    (L blood)(-1) for a-glucosidase, a-galactosidase A, and a-l-iduronidase, respectively. Blank values obtained in the absence of blood were 0.13, 0.24, and 0.45  mol    h(-1)    (L blood)(-1), respectively). By assaying 3 enzymes at once, problematic samples are spotted for reanalysis if enzyme activity values are low for all enzymes (for example, if insufficient blood is present in the assay). CONCLUSIONS: This method demonstrates that a triplex assay in a single buffer and with minimal supplies and labor can be adapted to a high-throughput newborn screening laboratory for the analysis of Pompe, Fabry, and mucopolysaccharidosis-I (Hurler) diseases.

22843569|t|Three-dimensional HepaRG model as an attractive tool for toxicity testing.
22843569|a|The culture of HepaRG cells as three dimensional (3D) structures in the spinner-bioreactor may represent added value as a hepatic system for toxicological purposes. The use of a cost-effective commercially available bioreactor, which is compatible with high-throughput cell analysis, constitutes an attractive approach for routine use in the drug testing industry. In order to assess specific aspects of the biotransformation capacity of the bioreactor-based HepaRG system, the induction of CYP450 enzymes (i.e., CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, and 3A4) and the activity of the phase II enzyme, uridine diphosphate glucuronoltransferase (UGT), were tested. The long-term functionality of the system was demonstrated by 7-week stable profiles of albumin secretion, CYP3A4 induction, and UGT activities. Immunofluorescence-based staining showed formation of tissue-like arrangements including bile canaliculi-like structures and polar distribution of transporters. The use of in silico models to analyze the in vitro data related to hepatotoxic activity of acetaminophen (APAP) demonstrated the advantage of the integration of kinetic and dynamic aspects for a better understanding of the in vitro cell behavior. The bioactivation of APAP and its related cytotoxicity was assessed in a system compatible to high-throughput screening. The approach also proved to be a good strategy to reduce the time necessary to obtain fully differentiated cell cultures. In conclusion, HepaRG cells cultured in 3D spinner-bioreactors are an attractive tool for toxicological studies, showing a liver-like performance and demonstrating a practical applicability for toxicodynamic approaches.

15027039|t|Efficacy of rivastigmine in subjects with moderately severe Alzheimer's disease.
15027039|a|BACKGROUND: Cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors are primarily used in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD), but may also be effective in more severe disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the dual ChE inhibitor, rivastigmine, in more severe dementia. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed pooled data from three randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 6-month trials, involving 2126 AD subjects. Subjects were selected according to baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score to identify subjects with more severe cognitive impairment (10-12 MMSE points). One-hundred-and-seventeen subjects were included who had been treated with rivastigmine 6-12 mg/day or placebo. The AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), the MMSE, a six-item subscore of the Progressive Deterioration Scale (PDS) and the BEHAVE-AD assessed efficacy. Tolerability was assessed by recording adverse events (AEs) and the relative risk (RR) of discontinuation. RESULTS: This group of subjects responded well to rivastigmine. After 6 months, the mean ADAS-Cog score declined by 6.3 points in the placebo group and increased by 0.2 points in the rivastigmine group (observed cases; p<0.001). Clinical benefits were also observed with the MMSE, the six-item PDS score and items of the BEHAVE-AD. Rivastigmine showed the same pattern of AEs as in other studies, but the RR of dropping out due to AEs was lower than in subjects with milder AD. CONCLUSION: Current treatment guidelines do not recommend treating individuals with severe AD with ChE inhibitors. However, this retrospective analysis suggests that rivastigmine 6-12 mg/day may benefit subjects with more severe disease, as well as subjects with mild to moderate impairment.

10462699|t|Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4 activities as well as induction of Cdk inhibitors p21 and p27 during growth arrest of human breast carcinoma cells by (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate.
10462699|a|(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) potently inhibits cell proliferation and suppresses tumor growth both in vitro and vivo, but little is known regarding the cell cycle regulatory proteins mediating these effects. This study investigated the effects of EGCG and other catechins on the cell cycle progression. DNA flow cytometric analysis indicated that 30 microM of EGCG blocked cell cycle progression at G1 phase in asynchronous MCF-7 cells. In addition, cells exposed to 30 microM of EGCG remained in the G1 phase after release from aphidicolin block. Over a 24-h exposure to EGCG, the Rb protein changed from hyper- to hypophosphorylated form and G1 arrest developed. The protein expression of cyclin D1, and E reduced slightly under the same conditions. Immunocomplex kinase experiments showed that EGCG inhibited the activities of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) and 4 (Cdk4) in a dose-dependent manner in the cell-free system. As the cells were exposed to EGCG (30 microM) over 24 h a gradual loss of both Cdk2 and Cdk4 kinase activities occurred. EGCG also induced the expression of the Cdk inhibitor p21 protein and this effect correlated with the increase in p53 levels. The level of p21 mRNA also increased under the same conditions. In addition, EGCG also increased the expression of the Cdk inhibitor p27 protein within 6 h after EGCG treatment. These results suggest that EGCG either exerts its growth-inhibitory effects through modulation of the activities of several key G1 regulatory proteins such as Cdk2 and Cdk4 or mediates the induction of Cdk inhibitor p21 and p27.

10607942|t|Lipid peroxidation levels in rat cardiac muscle are affected by age and thyroid status.
10607942|a|Free radicals, hydroxyperoxides and H(2)O(2) are all known to damage cell components. This study was designed to compare the concentrations of hydroxyperoxide and free radical scavengers in the cardiac muscles of old rats in the hyper- or hypothyroid condition, to determine whether rates of peroxidation would differ with age, thyroid status, or both. Rats were rendered hyper- or hypothyroid by administration of l-thyroxine or methimazole for 4 weeks. Among the old rats, the lipid peroxide (LPO) concentrations, measured as thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reactants, were significantly greater in the hyperthyroid than in the euthyroid state and the LPO concentrations measured as TBA+Fe(3+) reactants, which may be precursors of LPO, were significantly greater in the hyperthyroid state, whereas in young rats, the LPO concentrations measured by TBA or TBA+Fe(3+) methods did not differ significantly in the hyperthyroid state. In the euthyroid state, the concentration of LPO measured as TBA+Fe(3+) reactants was significantly reduced with age. Xanthine oxidase (XOD) activity also was markedly increased with age, being more pronounced in the hyperthyroid than in the euthyroid state. The Mn and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase activities were greater in the hyperthyroid than in the euthyroid state. Glutathione peroxidase activity decreased with age in the euthyroid and, particularly, in the hyperthyroid state. Catalase activity was not affected in the old rats. Concentrations of alpha-tocopherol in the old rats were high in the hyperthyroid state and low in the hypothyroid state, whereas the levels of beta- and gamma-tocopherols in these rats were unchanged in both conditions as compared with the euthyroid state findings. Data suggest that the site of free radical generation differs in older rats, with additional shifts in the location of intracellular lipid peroxidation being noted during hyperthyroidism. Thus, as rats age, the reduction of the free radical scavenger system and the increase in LPO and XOD activities might induce myocardial dysfunction.

25158061|t|Lack of endogenous adenosine tonus on sympathetic neurotransmission in spontaneously hypertensive rat mesenteric artery.
25158061|a|BACKGROUND: Increased sympathetic activity has been implicated in hypertension. Adenosine has been shown to play a role in blood flow regulation. In the present study, the endogenous adenosine neuromodulatory role, in mesenteric arteries from normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats, was investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: The role of endogenous adenosine in sympathetic neurotransmission was studied using electrically-evoked [3H]-noradrenaline release experiments. Purine content was determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. Localization of adenosine A1 or A2A receptors in adventitia of mesenteric arteries was investigated by Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy. Results indicate a higher electrically-evoked noradrenaline release from hypertensive mesenteric arteries. The tonic inhibitory modulation of noradrenaline release is mediated by adenosine A1 receptors and is lacking in arteries from hypertensive animals, despite their purine levels being higher comparatively to those determined in normotensive ones. Tonic facilitatory adenosine A2A receptor-mediated effects were absent in arteries from both strains. Immunohistochemistry revealed an adenosine A1 receptors redistribution from sympathetic fibers to Schwann cells, in adventitia of hypertensive mesenteric arteries which can explain, at least in part, the absence of effects observed for these receptors. CONCLUSION: Data highlight the role of purines in hypertension revealing that an increase in sympathetic activity in hypertensive arteries is occurring due to a higher noradrenaline/ATP release from sympathetic nerves and the loss of endogenous adenosine inhibitory tonus. The observed nerve-to-glial redistribution of inhibitory adenosine A1 receptors in hypertensive arteries may explain the latter effect.

28300622|t|Influence of measurement uncertainty on the world health organization recommended regulation for mainstream cigarette smoke constituents.
28300622|a|The World Health Organization Study Group on Tobacco Product Regulation (WHO TobReg) proposed mandated ceilings on 9 prioritized mainstream cigarette smoke constituents determined from the market-specific median of nicotine-normalized yield distributions. Considering the requirements for assessing and reporting of compliance with ceilings, it is of great importance to estimate the measurement uncertainty. To have a better understanding of influence of measurement uncertainty on the WHO recommended regulation for cigarette smoke constituents, in the present study, the measurement uncertainties were evaluated systematically based on series of collaborative studies reported by three different authorities over the years from 2012 to 2016, according to the approaches guided in ISO/TS 21748. Furthermore, the compliance assessment of 20 representative cigarette samples with proposed ceilings was conducted by taking measurement uncertainty into account. This work demonstrated that measurement uncertainty had great influence on the implementation of the regulated mandated lowering of toxic smoke constituents, both on the setting of ceilings and the compliance assessment as well.

17650175|t|Mechanisms of melanogenesis inhibition by 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3(2H)-furanone.
17650175|a|BACKGROUND: Increased production and accumulation of melanin is characteristic of a large number of skin diseases, including acquired hyperpigmentation such as melasma, postinflammatory melanoderma and solar lentigo. Thus, there is a increasing need for the development of depigmenting agents. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the depigmenting capacity of 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3(2H)-furanone (DMHF) and to elucidate the mechanisms by which it inhibits alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH)-induced melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells in vitro. METHODS: Several experiments were performed in B16 melanoma cells. We studied melanin content, tyrosinase activity and cAMP production, and performed cAMP response element (CRE) luciferase reporter assay and Western blots for proteins involved in melanogenesis. RESULTS: The melanin content and tyrosinase activity induced by alpha-MSH were inhibited significantly by DMHF. To clarify the mechanism of the depigmenting property of DMHF, we examined the involvement of DMHF in cAMP signalling induced by alpha-MSH. In CRE luciferase reporter assay, CRE reporter activation induced by alpha-MSH was inhibited by DMHF. Additionally, although DMHF did not inhibit cAMP production by alpha-MSH, both CRE binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and the reduction of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta phosphorylation by alpha-MSH were blocked by DMHF. These data suggest that DMHF inhibits the downstream step of cAMP production induced by alpha-MSH, consequently inhibiting melanogenesis. This suggestion was further confirmed by the fact that the increased production levels of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein-1 induced by alpha-MSH were all reduced by DMHF in B16 melanoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that DMHF inhibits alpha-MSH-induced melanogenesis by suppressing CREB phosphorylation, which is induced by protein kinase A, and suggests that DMHF may be an effective inhibitor of hyperpigmentation.

10994758|t|Comparison of renal sympathetic baroreflex effects of rilmenidine and alpha-methylnoradrenaline in the ventrolateral medulla of the rabbit.
10994758|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of imidazoline receptors and alpha2-adrenoceptors in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) on the renal sympathetic baroreflex. METHODS: The effects of rilmenidine (4 nmol) and alpha-methylnoradrenaline (alpha-MNA, 80 nmol) micro-injected into the RVLM of urethane-anaesthetized rabbits previously implanted with renal nerve recording electrodes were examined before and after micro-injection of the imidazoline receptor/alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan and the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist 2-methoxyidazoxan (2-MI). RESULTS: Rilmenidine and alpha-MNA both lowered mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 28% and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) by 35%, and reduced RSNA upper plateaus and ranges by 30-70%. Rilmenidine decreased both sympathetic burst frequency and amplitude while alpha-MNA reduced amplitude only. Rilmenidine shifted the RSNA baroreflex curve to the left while alpha-MNA shifted the curve to the right Idazoxan (13 nmol) reversed the hypotension and all RSNA effects of rilmenidine, while 2-MI (4 nmol) increased MAP 18% above the control and also reversed all RSNA parameters. By contrast, 2-MI reversed the alpha-MNA-induced hypotension and partially restored RSNA and the upper plateau of the RSNA baroreflex curve. Idazoxan treatment only partially reversed the hypotension after alpha-MNA and had no effect on any of the baroreflex curves. CONCLUSION: Both alpha-MNA and rilmenidine injected into the RVLM of rabbits produce renal sympathetic inhibition, but differences in the location of the baroreflex curve and the pattern of effects on burst amplitude and frequency suggest different mechanisms of action. The effects of idazoxan suggest that rilmenidine acts via imidazoline receptors. Since 2-MI reversed the actions of alpha-MNA and also rilmenidine, this suggests that alpha2-adrenoceptor hypotension can be produced in the rabbit RVLM and that rilmenidine may activate alpha2-adrenoceptors, possibly as a result of activating imidazoline receptors.

12679034|t|Soluble dimeric prion protein binds PrP(Sc) in vivo and antagonizes prion disease.
12679034|a|Conversion of cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) into a pathological conformer (PrP(Sc)) is thought to be promoted by PrP(Sc) in a poorly understood process. Here, we report that in wild-type mice, the expression of PrP(C) rendered soluble and dimeric by fusion to immunoglobulin Fcgamma (PrP-Fc(2)) delays PrP(Sc) accumulation, agent replication, and onset of disease following inoculation with infective prions. In infected PrP-expressing brains, PrP-Fc(2) relocates to lipid rafts and associates with PrP(Sc) without acquiring protease resistance, indicating that PrP-Fc(2) resists conversion. Accordingly, mice expressing PrP-Fc(2) but lacking endogenous PrP(C) are resistant to scrapie, do not accumulate PrP-Fc(2)(Sc), and do not transmit disease to others. These results indicate that various PrP isoforms engage in a complex in vivo, whose distortion by PrP-Fc(2) affects prion propagation and scrapie pathogenesis. The unique properties of PrP-Fc(2) suggest that soluble PrP derivatives may represent a new class of prion replication antagonists.

10053169|t|Rapid and sensitive reporter gene assays for detection of antiandrogenic and estrogenic effects of environmental chemicals.
10053169|a|Reports on increasing incidences in developmental abnormalities of the human male reproductive tract and the recent identifications of environmental chemicals with antiandrogenic activity necessitate the screening of a larger number of compounds in order to get an overview of potential antiandrogenic chemicals present in our environment. Thus, there is a great need for an effective in vitro screening method for (anti)androgenic chemicals. We have developed a rapid, sensitive, and reproducible reporter gene assay for detection of antiandrogenic chemicals. Chinese Hamster Ovary cells were cotransfected with the human androgen receptor expression vector and the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV)2-luciferase vector using the new nonliposomal transfection reagent FuGene. Stimulation of the cells for 24 h with the synthetic androgen receptor agonist, R1881 (10 nM), resulted in a 30- to 60-fold induction of luciferase activity. The classical antiandrogenic compounds hydroxy-flutamide, bicalutamide, spironolactone, and cyproterone acetate together with the pesticide(metabolite)s, vinclozolin, p,p'-DDE, and procymidone all potently inhibited the response to 0.1 nM R1881. Compared to the traditional calcium phosphate transfection method, this method has the advantage of being more feasible, as the assay can be scaled down to the microtiter plate format. Furthermore, the transfection reagent is noncytotoxic, allowing its addition together with the test compounds thereby reducing the hands-on laboratory time. This assay is a powerful tool for the efficient and accurate determination and quantification of the effects of antiandrogens on reporter gene transcription. To extend the application of FuGene, the reagent was shown to be superior compared to Lipofectin for transfecting MCF7 human breast cancer cells with an estrogen response element-luciferase vector. Thus, FuGene may prove to be valuable in diverse reporter gene assays involving transient transfections for screening of potential endocrine disruptors for (anti)androgenic and (anti)estrogenic properties.

16389564|t|Hydroxyurea responses and fetal hemoglobin induction in beta-thalassemia/HbE patients' peripheral blood erythroid cell culture.
16389564|a|Due to genetic heterogeneity of beta-thalassemia (beta-thal) patients, several efforts have been undertaken to determine the efficacy of hydroxyurea treatment. The aim of this work is to determine the responder and nonresponder for hydroxyurea treatment in beta-thal intermedia based on gamma-globin mRNA and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction in human erythroid progenitor cells purified from a patient's peripheral blood. Eighteen beta-thal/hemoglobin E patients [13 beta(E)/codon41/42(-TCTT), 4 beta(E)/codon17, and 1 beta(E)/IVS-654], requiring blood transfusion occasionally, with Hb levels of 5.20-8.50 g/dl were studied. The relative levels of gamma-globin mRNA was measured by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and HbF by high-performance liquid chromatography. The results indicated that erythroid progenitor cells treated with 30 mumol/l hydroxyurea for 96 h preferentially enhanced (G)gamma-and (A)gamma-globin mRNA. The mean values of (G)gamma-globin mRNA fold induction were higher than (A)gamma-globin mRNA (12+/-4 vs 4+/-0.30), the Pearson's correlation of (G)gamma-and (A)gamma-globin mRNA was r=0.80. Induction of (G)gamma/(A)gamma globin mRNA is up to ninefold. A 30% increase in the proportion of HbF out of the total Hb was found in cultures derived from four patients, 20-30% in cultures from nine patients, and less than 20% in cultures from five patients. In cultures from only two patients, increase in the proportion of HbF was less than 3%, and (G)gamma/(A)gamma globin mRNA is less than 0.50.

22658148|t|Novel missense variants in LCAT and APOB genes in an Italian kindred with familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency and hypobetalipoproteinemia.
22658148|a|BACKGROUND: Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is responsible for cholesterol esterification in plasma. Mutations of LCAT gene cause familial LCAT deficiency, a metabolic disorder characterized by hypoalphalipoproteinemia. Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is the main protein component of very-low-density lipoproteins and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Mutations of APOB gene cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, a codominant disorder characterized by low plasma levels of LDL cholesterol and apoB. OBJECTIVE: This was a genetic and biochemical analysis of an Italian kindred with hypobetalipoproteinemia whose proband presented with hypoalphalipoproteinemia and severe chronic kidney disease. METHODS: Plasma lipids and apolipoproteins, cholesterol esterification, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subclass distribution were analyzed. LCAT and APOB genes were sequenced. RESULTS: The proband had severe impairment of plasma cholesterol esterification and high preb-HDL content. He was heterozygote for the novel LCAT P406L variant, as were two other family members. The proband's wife and children presented with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia and were heterozygotes for the novel apoB H1401R variant. Cholesterol esterification rate of apoB H1401R carriers was reduced, likely attributable to the low amount of circulating LDL. After renal transplantation, proband's lipid profile, HDL subclass distribution, and plasma cholesterol esterification were almost at normal levels, suggesting a mild contribution of the LCAT P406L variant to his pretransplantation severe hypoalphalipoproteinemia and impairment of plasma cholesterol esterification. CONCLUSION: LCAT P406L variant had a mild effect on lipid profile, HDL subclass distribution, and plasma cholesterol esterification. ApoB H1401R variant was identified as possible cause of familial hypobetalipoproteinemia and resulted in a reduction of cholesterol esterification rate.

1970788|t|pH-dependent release of catecholamines from tyrosine hydroxylase and the effect of phosphorylation of Ser-40.
1970788|a|Bovine adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is isolated in a partially inhibited state with the feed-back inhibitors adrenaline and noradrenaline tightly coordinated to high-spin (S = 5/2) Fe(III) at the active site. In addition to the charge-transfer interaction with iron, an additional charged group in the polypeptide chain, with an apparent pKa of about 5.3 at 4 degrees C, is involved in the binding of catecholamines. Protonation of this group increases the pseudo-first order rate constant for the dissociation of the TH-[3H]noradrenaline complex more than 100-fold at 4 degrees C. At pH 7.0 and 30 degrees C, phosphorylation of Ser-40 causes a 6-fold increase in the rate constant for this dissociation.

22096562|t|The role of proline rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) on cisplatin resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma.
22096562|a|AIMS: We previously demonstrated Proline rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) plays important roles in regulating tumor progression, migration and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we aimed to examine the role of proline rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) on cisplatin resistance in HCC and to explore its underlying molecular mechanism. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Stable transfectants either overexpressing or suppressing Pyk2 were established in different HCC cell lines. MTT, colony formation and Annexin-V assays were employed to examine their in vitro responses to cisplatin. Xenograft ectopic and orthotopic nude mice models were generated to investigate the in vivo responses of them to cisplatin treatment. cDNA microarray was performed to identify Pyk2-induced genes which were further validated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using clinical HCC samples. In vitro functional study demonstrated that Pyk2-overexpressing HCC transfectants exhibited relatively lower cytotoxicity, higher colony-forming ability and lower apoptosis to cisplatin compared with the control transfectants. Moreover, Pyk2 overexpressing HCC transfectants had a higher survival rate under cisplatin treatment by up-regulation of AKT phosphorylation. In vivo xenograft nude mice model demonstrated that Pyk2-overexpressing transfectants developed higher tolerance to cisplatin treatment together with less tumor necrosis and apoptosis. cDNA microarray analysis revealed that there were more than 4,000 genes differentially expressed upon overexpression of Pyk2. Several upregulated genes were found to be involved in drug resistance and invasion in cancers. Among them, the expression profiles of MDR1, GAGE1, STAT1 and MAP7 were significantly associated with the expression of Pyk2 in clinical HCC samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our results may suggest a new evidence of Pyk2 on promoting cisplatin resistance of HCC cells through preventing cell apoptosis, activation of AKT pathway and upregulation of drug resistant genes.

24275229|t|Modulation of transient receptor vanilloid 1 activity by transient receptor potential ankyrin 1.
24275229|a|Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a nonselective ligand-gated cation channel responding to noxious heat, protons, and chemicals such as capsaicin. TRPV1 is expressed in sensory neurons and plays a critical role in pain associated with tissue injury, inflammation, and nerve lesions. Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is coexpressed with TRPV1. It is activated by compounds that cause a burning sensation (e.g., mustard oil) and, indirectly, by components of the inflammatory milieu eliciting nociceptor excitation and pain hypersensitivity. Previous studies indicate an interaction of TRPV1 and TRPA1 signaling pathways. Here we sought to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying such interactions in nociceptive neurons. We first excluded physical interactions of both channels using radioligand binding studies. By microfluorimetry, electrophysiological experiments, cAMP measurements, and site-directed mutagenesis we found a sensitization of TRPV1 after TRPA1 stimulation with mustard oil in a calcium and cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent manner. TRPA1 stimulation enhanced TRPV1 phosphorylation via the putative PKA phosphorylation site serine 116. We also detected calcium-sensitive increased TRPV1 activity after TRPA1 activation in dorsal root ganglion neurons. The inhibition of TRPA1 by HC-030031 (1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-1,3-dimethyl-N-[4-(1-methylethyl)phenyl]-2,6-dioxo-7H-purine-7-acetamide, 2-(1,3-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-7H-purin-7-yl)-N-(4-isopropylphenyl)acetamide) after its initial stimulation (and the calcium-insensitive TRPA1 mutant D477A) still showed increased capsaicin-induced TRPV1 activity. This excludes a calcium-induced additive TRPA1 current after TRPV1 stimulation. Our study shows sensitization of TRPV1 via activation of TRPA1, which involves adenylyl cyclase, increased cAMP, subsequent translocation and activation of PKA, and phosphorylation of TRPV1 at PKA phosphorylation residues. This suggests that cross-sensitization of TRP channels contributes to enhanced pain sensitivity in inflamed tissues.

7526840|t|Inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by galanin in rat insulinoma cells is mediated by the G-protein Gi3.
7526840|a|Galanin inhibits adenylate cyclase activity and insulin secretion and modulates ion channels in pancreatic beta-cells through pertussis-toxin-sensitive G-protein(s). Antibodies directed against the C-terminal region of specific G-protein alpha-subunits were used to determine which G-protein(s) couple galanin receptors to inhibition of adenylate cyclase in the rat insulinoma cell line RINm5F. Preincubation of membranes with EC antibody (anti-alpha i3) decreased the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity by galanin (100 nM) by 45% compared with control IgG (P < 0.05) whereas preincubation with AS (anti-alpha i1, alpha i2) or GO (anti-alpha o) antibodies had no significant effect. To confirm these results, RINm5F cells were exposed intermittently over a 4-day period to phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides that were either sense or antisense to alpha i1, alpha i2, alpha i3 or alpha o. Oligodeoxynucleotides antisense to alpha i2, alpha i3 and alpha o specifically decreased the levels of the targeted alpha-subunit in membranes. alpha i1 was undetectable in these cells. Inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by galanin was largely abolished in membranes from cells exposed to the oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to alpha i3, whereas all other oligodeoxynucleotides had no significant effect on this pathway. Indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblotting of specific membrane fractions with EC antibody show significant localization of alpha i3 to intracellular membrane compartments. These results suggest that Gi3 is the G protein that couples galanin receptors to inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity in RINm5F cells.

23042518|t|Barrier protective effects of rosmarinic acid on HMGB1-induced inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo.
23042518|a|High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is a crucial cytokine that mediates response to infection, injury, and inflammation. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is an important component of the leaves of Perilla frutescens and has neuroprotective, anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, and anti-cancer effects but little is known of its effects on HMGB1-mediated inflammatory response. Here, we investigated this issue by monitoring the effects of RA on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-mediated release of HMGB1 and HMGB1-mediated modulation of inflammatory responses. RA potently inhibited the release of HMGB1 and down-regulated HMGB1-dependent inflammatory responses in human endothelial cells. RA also inhibited HMGB1-mediated hyperpermeability and leukocyte migration in mice. Furthermore, RA reduced CLP-induced HMGB1 release and sepsis-related mortality. Given these results, RA should be viewed as a candidate therapeutic agent for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases via inhibition of the HMGB1 signaling pathway.

2865258|t|The slow, tight binding of bestatin and amastatin to aminopeptidases.
2865258|a|Bestatin reversibly inhibits Aeromonas aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.10) in a process that is remarkable for its unusual degree of time dependence. The binding of bestatin by both Aeromonas aminopeptidase and cytosolic leucine aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.1) is slow and tight, with Ki values (determined from rate constants) of 1.8 X 10(-8) and 5.8 X 10(-10) M, respectively. In contrast, microsomal aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.2) binds bestatin in a rapidly reversible process with a Ki value of 1.4 X 10(-6) M. Kinetic analysis of the slow inhibition observed is facilitated by the use of a variety of experimental treatments, primarily measurements made during pre-equilibrium; however, careful selection of conditions permits use also of steady state observations. When titrated with bestatin, 1 mol of cytosolic leucine aminopeptidase (containing 6 g atoms each of zinc and manganese) is rendered 80% inactive by 1 mol of inhibitor, thus suggesting that enzymatic activity depends on one active site/hexamer; titration of Aeromonas aminopeptidase by bestatin reveals a 1:1 stoichiometry. Amastatin inhibits all three aminopeptidases through the mechanism of slow, tight binding with Ki values ranging from 3.0 X 10(-8) to 2.5 X 10(-10) M. This behavior of microsomal aminopeptidase contrasts sharply with its rapidly reversible inhibition by bestatin. The slow, tight binding observed with five of the six aminopeptidase-inhibitor pairs investigated suggests the formation of a transition state analog complex between the enzyme and inhibitor. Physical evidence consistent with this possibility was provided by the observation that both bestatin and amastatin perturb the absorption spectrum of cobalt Aeromonas aminopeptidase.

22944422|t|Mechanical and barrier properties of nanocrystalline cellulose reinforced chitosan based nanocomposite films.
22944422|a|Nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) reinforced chitosan-based biodegradable films were prepared by solution casting. The NCC content in the films was varied from 1 to 10% (dry wt. basis). It was found that the tensile strength (TS) of the nanocomposite films with 5% (w/w) NCC content was optimum with an improvement of 26% compared to the control chitosan films. Incorporation of NCC also significantly improved barrier properties. Water vapor permeability (WVP) of the chitosan/NCC films was decreased by 27% for the optimum 5% (w/w) NCC content. Swelling studies revealed a decrease in water uptake of the NCC-reinforced chitosan films. Analyses of thermal properties showed no significant effect of NCC whereas X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the appearance of crystalline peaks in the nanocomposite films. Surface morphology of the films was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and it was found that NCC was dispersed homogenously into chitosan matrix.

18031717|t|Minocycline and hypothermia for reperfusion injury after focal cerebral ischemia in the rat: effects on BBB breakdown and MMP expression in the acute and subacute phase.
18031717|a|Reperfusion injury is a complication of recanalization therapies after focal cerebral ischemia. The disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) caused by up-regulated metalloproteinases (MMPs) can lead to edema and hemorrhage. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO=90 min) and reperfusion (R=24 h vs. 5 days) was induced in male Wistar rats. Rats were randomized in four groups: (1) control (C), (2) twice daily minocycline (30 mg/kg bodyweight) every day (M), (3) hypothermia (33 degrees C) for 4 h starting 60 min after occlusion (H), (4) combination of groups 2 and 3 (MH). Serial MRI was performed regarding infarct evolution and BBB disruption, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assessed by zymography of serum and ischemic brain tissue, and a functional neuroscore was done at 24 h and 5 days. M and H reduced both infarct sizes, volume and signal intensity of BBB breakdown and improved neuroscore at all points in time to the same extent. This was most likely due to inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9. The presence of MMP-9 at 24 h or MMP-2 at 5 days in brain tissue correlated with BBB breakdown whereas serum MMP-2- and -9 showed no relationship with BBB breakdown. The combination MH had a small but not significantly additional effect over the single treatments. Minocycline seems to be as neuroprotective as hypothermia in the acute and subacute phase after cerebral ischemia. One essential mechanism is the inhibition of MMPs. The combination therapy is only slightly superior. The net effect of MMPs inhibition up to 5 days after focal cerebral ischemia is still beneficial.

18783302|t|Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cinacalcet in hepatic impairment : phase I, open-label, parallel-group, single-dose, single-centre study.
18783302|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The calcimimetic cinacalcet lowers blood para-thyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphorus levels and calcium-phosphorus product in patients with chronic kidney disease receiving dialysis. Cinacalcet is metabolized primarily through oxidative and conjugative pathways. Hepatic disease has the potential to alter cinacalcet metabolism. Thus, it is important to establish the potential for altered cinacalcet metabolism according to the level of hepatic function. This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cinacalcet in subjects with different degrees of hepatic function. METHODS: This was a phase I, open-label, single-dose, parallel-group, single-centre study that included 24 subjects (six with normal hepatic function and six each with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment according to Child-Pugh criteria). Subjects were given a single 50 mg oral dose of cinacalcet. Blood samples were taken for pharmacokinetic (pre-dose and up to 120 hours post-dose) and pharmacodynamic (pre-dose and up to 72 hours post-dose) evaluations. Plasma concentrations of cinacalcet were determined using a validated normal phase turbo ion spray liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry assay. Serum ionized calcium levels were determined by standard biochemical measures, and PTH levels were determined using an immunometric intact PTH (iPTH) assay. The primary endpoints of the study were area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to time t (AUC(t)), AUC from 0 to infinity (AUC(infinity)) and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)). Other pharmacokinetic parameters (time to C(max) [t(max)], terminal half-life [t((1/2))(beta)], total body clearance [CL/F] and protein binding) and the effect of cinacalcet on plasma PTH and serum calcium were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Total cinacalcet exposure (AUC(infinity)) was comparable in subjects with normal hepatic function and mild hepatic impairment. In subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, mean AUC(infinity) was 2.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, than in healthy subjects. Cinacalcet t((1/2))(beta) was 1.3- and 1.7-fold longer in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Mean C(max) and t(max), as well as protein binding, were similar in all groups. Consistent with the increase in cinacalcet exposure, decreases in iPTH tended to be greater and prolonged in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. In this study, cinacalcet was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that cinacalcet can be used without dose adjustment in patients with mild hepatic impairment. However, increased drug exposure observed in subjects with moderate to severe hepatic impairment indicates that iPTH and serum calcium levels should be monitored closely and physicians should be more cautious about dose titration in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

19368415|t|Pharmacological management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: focus on recent developments.
19368415|a|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is associated with a significant deterioration in quality of life. The emetogenicity of the chemotherapeutic agents, repeated chemotherapy cycles and patient risk factors significantly influence CINV. Serotonin 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists plus dexamethasone have significantly improved the control of acute CINV, but delayed CINV remains a significant clinical problem. Two new agents, palonosetron and aprepitant, have recently been approved for the prevention of both acute and delayed CINV. Palonosetron is a second-generation 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist with a longer half-life and a higher binding affinity than first-generation 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. Aprepitant is the first agent available in the new drug class of neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists. Casopitant is another NK-1 receptor antagonist, which is under review by the US FDA after recent completion of phase III clinical trials. The introduction of these new agents has generated revised antiemetic guidelines for the prevention of CINV. Future studies may consider the use of palonosetron, aprepitant and casopitant with other antiemetic agents (e.g. olanzapine, gabapentin, cannabinoids) in moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy, as well as in the clinical settings of multiple-day chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation.

8960363|t|Molecular mechanisms underlying he interaction of motuporin and microcystins with type-1 and type-2A protein phosphatases.
8960363|a|Heptapeptide microcystin and pentapeptide motuporin (nodularin-V) are equipotent inhibitors of type-1 and type-2A protein phosphatase catalytic subunits (PP-1c and PP-2Ac). Herein we describe elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction of these structurally similar hepatotoxins with PP-1c/PP-2Ac and identification of an important functional difference between their mode of interaction with these enzymes. Microcystin-LR, microcystin-LA, and microcystin-LL were found to interact with PP-2Ac and PP-1c by a two-step mechanism involving rapid binding and inactivation of the protein phosphatase (PPase) catalytic subunit, followed by a slower covalent interaction (within hours). Covalent adducts comprising PPase-toxin complexes were separated from free PPase by C-18 reverse-phase liquid chromatography, thus allowing the time course of covalent adduct formation to be quantitated. In contrast to microcystins, motuporin (nodularin-V) and nodularin-R were unable to form covalent complexes with either PP-1c or PP-2Ac even after 96 h incubation. Specific reduction of microcystin-LA to dihydromicrocystin-LA abolished the ability of the toxin to form a covalent adduct with PP-2Ac. Specific methyl esterification of the single Glu residue in microcystin-LR rendered this toxin inactive as a PPase inhibitor and abolished subsequent formation of a covalent adduct. Our data indicate that inactivation of PP-2Ac/PP-1c by microcystins precedes covalent modification of the PPases via a Michael addition reaction between a nucleophilic phosphatase residue and Mdha in the heptapeptide toxin. In contrast, following rapid inactivation of PP-2Ac/PP-1c by motuporin, the equivalent N-methyldehydrobutyrine residue in this toxin is unreactive and does not form a covalent bond with the PPases. These results are consistent with structural data for (i) the NMR solution structures of microcystin-LR and motuporin, which indicate a striking difference in the relative positions of their corresponding dehydroamino acids in the toxin peptide backbone, and (ii) X-ray crystallographic data on an inactive complex between PP-1c and microcystin-LR, which show a covalent bond between Cys-273 and the bound toxin.

17122129|t|Inhibition of aldose reductase prevents lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in human lens epithelial cells.
17122129|a|PURPOSE: Bacterial infections are one of the major causes of human eye disease. Because the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is known to cause cytotoxicity through oxidative stress and an earlier study has shown that aldose reductase (AR) mediates oxidative stress signals, the purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of AR inhibition on LPS-induced activation of NF-kappaB-dependent signals in human lens epithelial cells (HLECs). METHODS: Growth-arrested HLECs were cultured without or with AR inhibitors or transfected with an AR small interfering (si)RNA. Subsequently, the cells were stimulated with LPS (1-10 mug/mL) for 24 hours. The cell viability was assessed by cell counts and MTT assay, and apoptosis was measured by nucleosomal degradation. Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays were performed to determine the activation of NF-kappaB and AP1. The levels of nitric oxide, MMP-2, MMP-9, Cox-2, and TNF-alpha were measured by using specific ELISA kits. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and the activation of PKC and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). RESULTS: Bacterial LPS caused apoptosis of HLECs. Inhibition of AR by two structurally unrelated inhibitors, sorbinil and tolrestat, or ablation by AR siRNA prevented the LPS-induced apoptosis, activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP protein. Inhibition of AR in HLECs also prevented the LPS-induced activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors such as NF-kappaB and AP1 and their downstream signals that lead to expression of Cox-2, MMP-2, MMP-9, and TNF-alpha proteins. In addition, inhibition of AR prevented LPS-induced activation of protein kinases upstream to NF-kappaB activation such as PKC and MAPK in HLECs. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that AR mediates the bacterial endotoxin signaling that could damage HLECs by regulating the signals that activate the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-kappaB and cause inflammation. Thus, inhibition of AR could be a therapeutic target for Gram-negative bacterial infection-induced visual complications.

18844338|t|Virtual screening to successfully identify novel janus kinase 3 inhibitors: a sequential focused screening approach.
18844338|a|In an effort to identify novel Janus kinase 3 inhibitors, a sequential focused screening approach was adopted to search our in-house chemical database. By biologically testing only 79 selected compounds, we successfully identified 19 compounds showing IC 50 < 20 microM, with four of them in the nanomolar range. Particularly, a 3,5-disubstituted pyrazolo[4,3- d]pyrimidine scaffold emerged as a promising candidate for further lead optimization. With the advantages of efficiency and flexibility, this approach may be utilized to identify leads for other therapeutic targets.

21764322|t|Identification of 3-aminomethyl-1,2-dihydro-4-phenyl-1-isoquinolones: a new class of potent, selective, and orally active non-peptide dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors that form a unique interaction with Lys554.
21764322|a|The design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships of a new class of potent and orally active non-peptide dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitors, 3-aminomethyl-1,2-dihydro-4-phenyl-1-isoquinolones, are described. We hypothesized that the 4-phenyl group of the isoquinolone occupies the S1 pocket of the enzyme, the 3-aminomethyl group forms an electrostatic interaction with the S2 pocket, and the introduction of a hydrogen bond donor onto the 6- or 7-substituent provides interaction with the hydrophilic region of the enzyme. Based on this hypothesis, intensive research focused on developing new non-peptide DPP-4 inhibitors has been carried out. Among the compounds designed in this study, we identified 2-[(3-aminomethyl-2-(2-methylpropyl)-1-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-6-isoquinolinyl)oxy]acetamide (35a) as a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable DPP-4 inhibitor, which exhibited in vivo efficacy in diabetic model rats. Finally, X-ray crystallography of 35a in a complex with the enzyme validated our hypothesized binding mode and identified Lys554 as a new target-binding site available for DPP-4 inhibitors.

26467602|t|Adolescent D-amphetamine treatment in a rodent model of ADHD: Pro-cognitive effects in adolescence without an impact on cocaine cue reactivity in adulthood.
26467602|a|Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is comorbid with cocaine abuse. Whereas initiating ADHD medication in childhood does not alter later cocaine abuse risk, initiating medication during adolescence may increase risk. Preclinical work in the Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (SHR) model of ADHD found that adolescent methylphenidate increased cocaine self-administration in adulthood, suggesting a need to identify alternatively efficacious medications for teens with ADHD. We examined effects of adolescent d-amphetamine treatment on strategy set shifting performance during adolescence and on cocaine self-administration and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior (cue reactivity) during adulthood in male SHR, Wistar-Kyoto (inbred control), and Wistar (outbred control) rats. During the set shift phase, adolescent SHR needed more trials and had a longer latency to reach criterion, made more regressive errors and trial omissions, and exhibited slower and more variable lever press reaction times. d-Amphetamine improved performance only in SHR by increasing choice accuracy and decreasing errors and latency to criterion. In adulthood, SHR self-administered more cocaine, made more cocaine-seeking responses, and took longer to extinguish lever responding than control strains. Adolescent d-amphetamine did not alter cocaine self-administration in adult rats of any strain, but reduced cocaine seeking during the first of seven reinstatement test sessions in adult SHR. These findings highlight utility of SHR in modeling cognitive dysfunction and comorbid cocaine abuse in ADHD. Unlike methylphenidate, d-amphetamine improved several aspects of flexible learning in adolescent SHR and did not increase cocaine intake or cue reactivity in adult SHR. Thus, adolescent d-amphetamine was superior to methylphenidate in this ADHD model.

23178773|t|Clarification of olive mill and winery wastewater by means of clay-polymer nanocomposites.
23178773|a|Highly polluted effluents from olive mills and wineries, among others, are unsuitable for discharge into standard sewage-treatment plants due to the large amounts of organic and suspended matter. Efficiency of all management practices for such effluents depends on an effective pretreatment that lowers the amount of suspended solids. Such pretreatments are usually based on three separate stages, taking a total of 2 to 6h: coagulation-neutralizing the colloids, flocculation-aggregating the colloids into larger particles, and separation via filtration or decanting. Previous studies have presented the concept of coagoflocculation based on the use of clay-polymer nanocomposites. This process adds a higher density clay particle to the flocs, accelerating the process to between 15 and 60 min. This study examined suitable nanocomposites based on different clays and polymers. The charge of the compounds increased proportionally to the polymer-to-clay ratio. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements indicated that in sepiolite-based nanocomposites there is no change in the structure of the mineral, whereas in smectite-based nanocomposites, the polymer intercalates between the clay layers and increases the spacing depending on the polymer-to-clay ratio. Efficiency of the coagoflocculation process was studied with a dispersion analyzer. Sequential addition of olive mill or winery effluents with a boosting dose of nanocomposites may yield a very efficient and rapid clarification pretreatment.

10671321|t|BDNF blocks caspase-3 activation in neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.
10671321|a|Hypoxic-ischemic (H-I) injury to the brain in the perinatal period often leads to significant long-term neurological deficits. In a model of neonatal H-I injury in postnatal day 7 rats, our previous data have shown that cell death with features of apoptosis is prominent between 6 and 24 h after H-I and that neurotrophins, particularly BDNF, can markedly protect against tissue loss. During brain development, caspase-3 is required for normal levels of programmed cell death. Utilizing an antibody specific for the activated form of caspase-3, CM1, we now show that caspase-3 is specifically activated in neuronal cell bodies and their processes beginning at 6 h and peaking 24 h following unilateral carotid ligation and exposure to hypoxia in postnatal day 7 rats. Caspase-3 activation began to occur in cortex at 6 h and in striatum and hippocampus at 12-18 h. Caspase-3 activation was also observed in developing oligodendrocytes. Intracerebroventricular injection of BDNF prior to H-I injury almost completely abolished evidence of H-I-induced caspase-3 activation in vivo. Utilizing a specific molecular marker of an apoptotic pathway, these findings demonstrate that H-I injury to the developing brain is a strong apoptotic stimulus leading to caspase-3 activation, that BDNF can block this process in vivo, and that the ability of BDNF to inhibit caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis likely accounts in large part for its protection against neuronal injury in this model.

16436379|t|Helicobacter pylori vacuolating cytotoxin induces activation of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, leading to cytochrome c release and cell death, independent of vacuolation.
16436379|a|Helicobacter pylori vacuolating cytotoxin, VacA, which causes vacuolation of gastric epithelial cells and other types of cultured cells, is known to stimulate apoptosis via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. In the present study, we examined the mechanisms of VacA-induced mitochondrial damage. Intracellular VacA localization was monitored by immunostaining and confocal microscopy; in AZ-521 cells in which cytochrome c release was stimulated, most of VacA was localized to vacuoles rather than mitochondria. VacA reduced the membrane potential of isolated mitochondria without inducing cytochrome c release, suggesting that it did not act directly to induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria and that in intact cells, VacA-induced cytochrome c release involved apoptosis-related factor(s), such as a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein. In agreement, flow cyto-metric analyses using antibodies specific for activated Bax revealed that intracellular Bax was activated by VacA in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Using active form-specific antibodies, we also observed that the Bcl-2 family protein, Bak, was activated. By confocal microscopy, Bax and Bak were activated in AZ-521 cells in which cyto-chrome c release was induced by VacA. In addition, small interfering RNA-induced silencing of the bax gene resulted in reduction of VacA-stimulated cytochrome c release, consistent with a contribution of VacA-induced Bax activation to cytochrome c release. NH4Cl enhanced both VacA-induced vacuolation and Bax activation, whereas Bax activation was not inhibited by bafilomycin A1, which inhibited vacuolation caused by VacA. These results suggest that VacA acts through different signaling pathways to induce apoptosis via Bax activation, independent of vacuolation.

15377163|t|Effect of glutathione on the covalent binding of the 13C-labeled skin sensitizer 5-chloro-2-methylisothiazol-3-one to human serum albumin: identification of adducts by nuclear magnetic resonance, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, and nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry.
15377163|a|The covalent binding of 4-[(13)C]- and 5-[(13)C]-5-chloro-2-methylisothiazol-3-one (MCI) toward human serum albumin (HSA) was followed by (13)C and (1)H[(13)C] NMR spectroscopy. MCI was found to react with histidine through an addition-elimination at position 5, leading to stable substitution adducts, and with lysine to form open adducts of the thioamide or amide type. No other modification could be detected on either cysteine or tyrosine. In the presence of glutathione (GSH), we observed an increased covalent binding to lysine residues. This could be explained by the rapid reaction of GSH with MCI to form a chlorothioacyl intermediate very reactive toward primary amino groups of lysine residues. To further confirm these observations and map covalent binding sites, HSA samples modified by MCI with or without GSH were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry of tryptic digests and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry of modified peptides purified by reverse phase HPLC. About 80% of the HSA sequence was mapped, and several modified peptides were identified. When HSA was incubated with MCI without GSH, three peptides modified at histidine residues were characterized while when HSA was incubated in the presence of GSH, five peptides modified at histidine and lysine residues were identified. These experiments confirmed that modifications on lysine residues were of the amide and thioamide types. Observed modifications were in accordance with mass increases corresponding to structures identified by NMR, and an extra adduct corresponding to a double modification of His 338 was observed. Comparison of HSA-MCI and HSA-MCI-GSH samples confirmed that the presence of GSH increased the modification of lysine residues.

15690491|t|Ultrastructural localization of reelin in the cortex in post-mortem human brain.
15690491|a|Reelin is a glycoprotein that plays a critical role in brain development, including proper cortical lamination. In adult animals, reelin continues to be expressed in different neuronal populations in many brain regions. We performed labeling for reelin immunoreactivity (-i) in post-mortem cerebral cortex from five adults and two fetuses with three different antibodies. The tissue was then processed for light and electron microscopy. In cell bodies, reelin-i was found in pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons on the outer nuclear membrane, rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), and ribosomes. In dendrites, labeling was found in the rER and ribosomes and was diffusely distributed in spines. In the neuropil, diffuse labeling was seen in small axon terminals and unmyelinated axons, and the postsynaptic density (PSD) frequently had discrete labeling. Reelin-i was also found in glial somata and in small astrocytic processes. With rare exceptions, reelin-i in the adult was conspicuously absent from both the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the subcellular organelles, where secreted proteins are modified and taken back into the cell. Labeling in fetal cortex was similar to that in the adult except for prominent labeling in the ECM. The presence of reelin in adult spines, PSD, and terminals suggests that in the adult human reelin has a role in synaptic remodeling, which is consistent with the evidence for its role in long-term potentiation in the adult brain.

27412455|t|Long-Term Retrospective Analysis of Gene Therapy with Alipogene Tiparvovec and Its Effect on Lipoprotein Lipase Deficiency-Induced Pancreatitis.
27412455|a|Alipogene tiparvovec (Glybera) is a gene therapy product approved in Europe under the "exceptional circumstances" pathway as a treatment for lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD), a rare genetic disease resulting in chylomicronemia and a concomitantly increased risk of acute and recurrent pancreatitis, with potentially lethal outcome. This retrospective study analyzed the frequency and severity of pancreatitis in 19 patients with LPLD up to 6 years after a single treatment with alipogene tiparvovec. An independent adjudication board of three pancreas experts, blinded to patient identification and to pre- or post-gene therapy period, performed a retrospective review of data extracted from the patients' medical records and categorized LPLD-related acute abdominal pain events requiring hospital visits and/or hospitalizations based on the adapted 2012 Atlanta diagnostic criteria for pancreatitis. Both entire disease time period data and data from an equal time period before and after gene therapy were analyzed. Events with available medical record information meeting the Atlanta diagnostic criteria were categorized as definite pancreatitis; events treated as pancreatitis but with variable levels of laboratory and imaging data were categorized as probable pancreatitis or acute abdominal pain events. A reduction of approximately 50% was observed in all three categories of the adjudicated post-gene therapy events. Notably, no severe pancreatitis and only one intensive care unit admission was observed in the post-alipogene tiparvovec period. However, important inter- and intraindividual variations in the pre- and post-gene therapy incidence of events were observed. There was no relationship between the posttreatment incidence of events and the number of LPL gene copies injected, the administration of immunosuppressive regimen or the percent triglyceride decrease achieved at 12 weeks (primary end point in the prospective clinical studies). Although a causal relationship cannot be established and despite the limited number of individuals evaluated, results from this long-term analysis suggest that alipogene tiparvovec was associated with a lower frequency and severity of pancreatitis events, and a consequent overall reduction in health care resource use up to 6 years posttreatment.

18501650|t|A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study comparing arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution and racemic formoterol dry powder inhaler in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
18501650|a|BACKGROUND: Arformoterol is a single-isomer (R,R-formoterol) nebulized long-acting beta(2)-agonist approved for use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exposure (plasma concentrations of (R,R)-formoterol) and forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1)) were compared for 15 microg nebulized arformoterol and 12 and 24 microg racemic formoterol (containing 6 and 12 microg (R,R)-formoterol, respectively) delivered by dry powder inhaler (DPI). METHODS: An open-label, randomized, three-way crossover study in 39 subjects with COPD (FEV(1) 1.4L, 44.4% predicted). Twice-daily treatments included nebulized arformoterol (15 microg) and racemic formoterol DPI (12 and 24 microg) for 14 days. Plasma concentrations of (R,R)- and (S,S)-formoterol were determined on days 1 and 14 of each treatment period. Airway function efficacy endpoints included the percent change in trough FEV(1) from baseline on day 14 of each treatment period. RESULTS: At steady state, exposure to (R,R)-formoterol was similar following nebulized 15 microg arformoterol (C(max): 6.5 pg/mL; AUC(0-tau): 56.5 pgh/mL) and 12 microg racemic formoterol DPI (C(max): 6.2 pg/mL; AUC((0-)(tau)()): 46.3 pgh/mL). The geometric mean ratios between these two treatments (90% confidence intervals) for C(max) and AUC((0-)(tau)()) were 0.91 (0.76, 1.09) and 1.16 (1.00, 1.35), respectively. Treatment with 24 microg racemic formoterol DPI resulted in dose proportionally higher (R,R)-formoterol: C(max) (10.8 pg/mL) and AUC((0-)(tau)()) (83.6 pgh/mL). Detectable (S,S)-formoterol was consistently measured only after treatment with racemic formoterol. The mean percent increase in trough FEV(1) was 19.1% in the arformoterol group, and 16.0% and 18.2% in the 12 and 24 microg racemic formoterol groups, respectively. Changes in (R,R)-formoterol concentrations over time paralleled changes in FEV(1). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, plasma exposure to (R,R)-formoterol was similar for nebulized 15 microg arformoterol and 12 microg racemic formoterol DPI, and 40% lower than 24 microg racemic formoterol DPI. There was no evidence of chiral interconversion following treatment with arformoterol. Finally, temporal changes in airway function in all treatment groups corresponded to changes in (R,R)-formoterol plasma concentrations.

9269772|t|Anticoagulant effects of synthetic retinoids mediated via different receptors on human leukemia and umbilical vein endothelial cells.
9269772|a|We recently found that retinoic acids (RAs) exert anticoagulant effects by upregulating thrombomodulin (TM) and downregulating tissue factor (TF) expression in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells and monoblastic leukemia cells. Two classes of nuclear RA receptors, termed retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors, have been identified. Each receptor class consists of three subtypes. In the present study, we have used several synthetic retinoids to determine which receptor subtypes are involved in the regulation of TM and TF expression in NB4 APL cells, U937 monoblastic leukemia cells, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Am80, which has no binding affinity for RAR gamma, and Ch55, which does not bind to cytoplasmic retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP), upregulated TM and downregulated TF in NB4 and U937 cells, similar to all-trans RA (ATRA). A specific RAR alpha antagonist, Ro41-5253, significantly suppressed the upregulation of TM by ATRA and Am80 in NB4 cells, U937 cells, and HUVECs. In contrast, only with preincubation with both RAR alpha and RAR beta antagonists was downregulation of TF by retinoids suppressed in NB4 cells. These findings indicate that the mechanism of transactivation and transrepression functions of RARs are distinct and also elucidate the major role of RAR alpha in TM upregulation by retinoids in leukemic cells and HUVECs and the cooperation of RAR alpha and RAR beta in TF downregulation by retinoids. They also indicate that binding to CRABP is not required for the anticoagulant effect of retinoids and that synthetic retinoids will prove very useful in controlling distinct targets, the TM and TF genes, at the level of transcription, and will permit the development of retinoids with a new type of anticoagulant effect.

19926617|t|Role of a novel bile acid receptor TGR5 in the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
19926617|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mechanisms of the progression from Barrett's oesophagus to oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OA) are not fully understood. Bile acids may have an important role in this progression. This study aimed at examining the role of NADPH oxidase NOX5-S and a novel bile acid receptor TGR5 in taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA)-induced increase in cell proliferation. METHODS: Human Barrett's cell line BAR-T and OA cell line FLO were transfected by the Lipofectamine 2000 or Amaxa-Nucleofector-System. mRNAs were measured by real-time PCR. H(2)O(2) was measured by a fluorescent assay. Cell proliferation was determined by measurement of thymidine incorporation. RESULTS: NOX5-S was present in FLO cells. TDCA significantly increased NOX5-S expression, H(2)O(2) production and thymidine incorporation in FLO and BAR-T cells. This increase in thymidine incorporation was significantly reduced by knockdown of NOX5-S. TGR5 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in OA tissues than in normal oesophageal mucosa or Barrett's mucosa. Knockdown of TGR5 markedly inhibited TDCA-induced increase in NOX5-S expression, H(2)O(2) production and thymidine incorporation in FLO and BAR-T cells. Overexpression of TGR5 significantly enhanced the effects of TDCA in FLO cells. TGR5 receptors were coupled with Galphaq and Galphai3 proteins, but only Galphaq mediated TDCA-induced increase in NOX5-S expression, H(2)O(2) production and thymidine incorporation in FLO cells. CONCLUSIONS: TDCA-induced increase in cell proliferation depends on upregulation of NOX5-S expression in BAR-T and FLO cells. TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression may be mediated by activation of the TGR5 receptor and Galphaq protein. These data may provide potential targets to prevent and/or treat Barrett's OA.

17259401|t|PTPN22 R620W functional variant in type 1 diabetes and autoimmunity related traits.
17259401|a|The PTPN22 gene, encoding the lymphoid-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase, a negative regulator in the T-cell activation and development, has been associated with the susceptibility to several autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes. Based on combined case-control and family-based association studies, we replicated the finding of an association of the PTPN22 C1858T (R620W) functional variant with type 1 diabetes, which was independent from the susceptibility status at the insulin gene and at HLA-DR (DR3/4 compared with others). The risk contributed by the 1858T allele was increased in patients with a family history of other autoimmune diseases, further supporting a general role for this variant on autoimmunity. In addition, we found evidence for an association of 1858T allele with the presence of GAD autoantibodies (GADA), which was restricted to patients with long disease duration (>10 years, P < 0.001). This may help define a subgroup of patients with long-term persistence of GADA. The risk conferred by 1858T allele on GAD positivity was additive, and our meta-analysis also supported an additive rather than dominant effect of this variant on type 1 diabetes, similar to previous reports on rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

15330762|t|Insulin activates the rat sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) promoter through the combinatorial actions of SREBP, LXR, Sp-1 and NF-Y cis-acting elements.
15330762|a|The enhanced synthesis of fatty acids in the liver and adipose tissue in response to insulin is critically dependent on the transcription factor SREBP-1c (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein 1c). Insulin increases the expression of the SREBP-1c gene in intact liver and in hepatocytes cultured in vitro. To learn the mechanism of this stimulation, we analysed the activation of the rat SREBP-1c promoter and its truncated or mutated congeners driving a luciferase reporter gene in transiently transfected rat hepatocytes. The rat SREBP-1c promoter contains binding sites for LXR (liver X receptor), Sp1, NF-Y (nuclear factor-Y) and SREBP itself. We have found that each of these sites is required for the full stimulatory response of the SREBP-1c promoter to insulin. Mutation of either the putative LXREs (LXR response elements) or the SRE (sterol response element) in the proximal SREBP-1c promoter reduced the stimulatory effect of insulin by about 50%. Insulin and the LXR agonist TO901317 increased the association of SREBP-1 with the SREBP-1c promoter. Ectopic expression of LXRalpha or SREBP-1c increased activity of the SREBP-1c promoter, and this effect is further enhanced by insulin. The Sp1 and NF-Y sites adjacent to the SRE are also required for full activation of the SREBP-1c promoter by insulin. We propose that the combined actions of the SRE, LXREs, Sp1 and NF-Y elements constitute an insulin-responsive cis-acting unit of the SREBP-1c gene in the liver.

11882389|t|Functional plasticity of cyclic AMP hydrolysis in rat adenohypophysial corticotroph cells.
11882389|a|Characterisation of cyclic nucleotide-hydrolysing phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in recombinant systems has highlighted regulatory properties indicative of distinct physiological roles for these enzymes. The present study investigated the role of PDEs in the adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate (cAMP) response to the hypothalamic neuropeptides corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in acutely dispersed rat adenohypophysial cells. Ca(2+)-activated PDE (PDE1) and Ca(2+)-independent, rolipram-sensitive PDE (PDE4) accounted for close to 90% of cAMP-hydrolysing activity in the adenohypophysis. Messenger RNA transcripts of PDE1 (isotypes 1A and 1C) and PDE4 (isotypes B and D3) were detected by RT-PCR. The PDE blockers rolipram and IBMX enhanced cAMP accumulation induced by CRF or CRF and AVP. Vinpocetine, an inhibitor of low K(m) PDE1 isotypes, did not alter the response to CRF but enhanced the effect of the combined CRF/AVP stimulus. Thus, PDE4s terminate the cAMP response to moderate stimulation, while low-affinity PDE1 becomes important when the concentrations of CRF and AVP are characteristic of exposure to intensive stress.

7938785|t|Glufosinate (phosphinothricin), a natural amino acid with unexpected herbicidal properties.
7938785|a|Glufosinate ammonium (phosphinothricin ammonium) (GLA) is the active ingredient of Basta and several other herbicides used worldwide. It is produced as part of the tripeptide L-phosphinothricyl-L-alanyl-L-alanin, which was first isolated from Streptomyces viridichromogenes or Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Its structure is confirmed by degradation and synthesis. Several processes for the preparation of D,L- and L-phosphinothricin are described. Glufosinate is a structural analog of glutamate and inhibits the glutamine synthetase. The result is a rapid build-up of a high ammonia level and a concomitant depletion of glutamine and several other amino acids in the plant. These effects are accompanied by a rapid decline of photosynthetic CO2-fixation and are followed by chlorosis and desiccation. The results of numerous toxicological studies show that glufosinate ammonium and its commercial formulations are safe for users and consumers under the conditions of recommended use. The fast and complete degradation in soil and surface water prevents movement of residues into groundwater. The toxicological threshold levels for all the nontarget organisms tested are well above the potential exposure levels and therefore do not reflect any hazard for nontarget organisms in the ecosystem. Basta is a nonselective foliar applied herbicide for the control of undesirable mono- and dicotyledonous plants in orchards, vineyards, and plantations for minimum tillage, and as a harvest aid. A synthetic phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT) gene has been introduced via Agrobacterium tumefaciens into dicot crops, such as like tobacco, tomato, spring and winter rapeseed, alfalfa, and several horticultural crops. The PAT gene was also successfully introduced into maize protoplasts that could be regenerated into fertile plants. All transgenic crop plants tolerated a two- to threefold field dosage of Basta.

8632304|t|Role of imidazoline receptors in the cardiovascular actions of moxonidine, rilmenidine and clonidine in conscious rabbits.
8632304|a|The present study in conscious rabbits with intracisternal (i.c.) catheters sought to determine the relative contribution of the I1 subtype of imidazoline receptors (IR) and alpha 2 adrenoceptors to the hypotensive effects of rilmenidine, clonidine and moxonidine with an I1-IR/alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonist efaroxan and a specific alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonist 2-methoxyidazoxan (2-MI). The alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonist effect of efaroxan was compared with 2-MI by performing cumulative dose-response curves in the presence of alpha-methyldopa (400 micrograms/kg i.c.). 2-MI was 5.6 times more potent than efaroxan at reversing 75% of the hypotension elicited by alpha-methyldopa (P < .025). This dose ratio was used to match doses of efaroxan and 2-MI for similar alpha 2 adrenoceptor blockade. The effects of efaroxan (4.1, 13, 41 micrograms/kg i.c.) and 2-MI (0.74, 2.3, 7.4 micrograms/kg i.c.) were investigated on a single i.c. dose of rilmenidine (12 micrograms/kg), clonidine (0.75 microgram/kg) and moxonidine (0.51 microgram/kg). These doses of the antihypertensive agents, which were determined from cumulative dose-response curves, produce 90% of the maximum hypotension. Efaroxan was more effective at reversing the hypotension induced by moxonidine and rilmenidine than was 2-MI (P < .01). These findings suggest that rilmenidine and moxonidine act predominantly via IR. By contrast, 2-MI was more effective at reversing the clonidine-induced hypotension than was efaroxan (P < .001), suggesting that clonidine acts mainly via alpha 2 adrenoceptors in conscious normotensive rabbits. Thus, a higher selectivity of the second generation agents moxonidine and rilmenidine for I1-IR over alpha 2 adrenoceptors, compared with the first generation agent clonidine, appears to be necessary for this effect to be manifested in their hypotensive actions.

17270083|t|Ameliorating effects of essential oil from Acori graminei rhizoma on learning and memory in aged rats and mice.
17270083|a|Although there are normal cognitive changes that take place as a person becomes older, ageing in humans is generally associated with a deterioration of cognitive performance, in particular of learning and memory. There are a number of herbal medicines that are reported to improve brain function and intelligence. In the present study, the ameliorating effects of an essential oil extracted from Acori graminei rhizoma on learning and memory in aged, dysmnesia rats and mice were determined using the step-down passive avoidance test and Y maze. Oral administration of the essential oil (0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 g kg(-1)) to rats for 30 days and to mice for 15 days improved the latency and number of errors in aged, dysmnesia rats and mice. The cerebral neurotransmitters in aged rats given the essential oil (0.02, 0.04, 0.08 g kg(-1)) for 30 days were also investigated, and increased levels of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin, and decreased levels of acetylcholinesterase activity were found. The results suggest that the essential oil improves cognitive function in aged animals possibly by increasing norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin relative levels, and by decreasing the activity of acetylcholinesterase in the cerebra.

17305786|t|Decreased high-molecular-weight adiponectin in gestational diabetes: implications for the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes.
17305786|a|AIMS: Low serum concentrations of the insulin-sensitizing protein adiponectin predict the development of incident Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). It has recently emerged that the anti-diabetic activity of adiponectin may be mediated by its high-molecular-weight (HMW) isoform, circulating levels of which are decreased in T2DM. The relevance of decreased HMW adiponectin to incident T2DM, however, has not been assessed. Since gestational diabetes (GDM) identifies a population of young women at high risk of future T2DM (i.e. representing an early stage in the natural history of the disease), we sought to determine if decreased HMW adiponectin is a feature of GDM. METHODS: HMW and total adiponectin were measured in 121 women at the time of oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) in late pregnancy, following an abnormal glucose challenge test. Based on the OGTT, there were 41 women with and 80 without GDM. RESULTS: Median HMW adiponectin concentration was lower in women with GDM (3.5 microg/ml) than in those without GDM (5.5 microg/ml) (P < 0.0001). After full adjustment for covariates, mean HMW adiponectin remained significantly lower in women with GDM compared with their peers (3.6 vs. 5.3 microg/ml, P = 0.0035). HMW adiponectin was positively associated with insulin sensitivity (IS(OGTT)) (r = 0.38, P < 0.0001) and pancreatic B-cell function [insulin secretion-sensitivity index (ISSI)] (r = 0.33, P = 0.0002) and inversely related to blood glucose levels, including area-under-the-glucose-curve during the OGTT (AUC(glucose)) (r = -0.31, P = 0.0007). On separate multiple linear regression analyses, HMW adiponectin emerged as an independent determinant of AUC(glucose), IS(OGTT) and ISSI, respectively, mirroring the relationships of total adiponectin. CONCLUSIONS: HMW adiponectin is significantly decreased in women with GDM. Deficiency of HMW adiponectin may be an early event in the natural history of T2DM.

10085078|t|Xenopus cytosolic thyroid hormone-binding protein (xCTBP) is aldehyde dehydrogenase catalyzing the formation of retinoic acid.
10085078|a|Amino acid sequencing of an internal peptide fragment derived from purified Xenopus cytosolic thyroid hormone-binding protein (xCTBP) demonstrates high similarity to the corresponding sequence of mammalian aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) (Yamauchi, K., and Tata, J. R. (1994) Eur. J. Biochem. 225, 1105-1112). Here we show that xCTBP was co-purified with ALDH and 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) binding activities. By photoaffinity labeling with [125I]T3, a T3-binding site in the xCTBP was estimated to reside in amino acid residues 93-114, which is distinct from the active site of the enzyme but present in the NAD+ binding domain. The amino acid sequences deduced from the two isolated xALDH1 cDNAs (xALDH1-I and xALDH1-II) were 94.6% identical to each other and very similar to those of mammalian ALDH1 enzymes. The two recombinant xALDH1 proteins exhibit both T3 binding activity and ALDH activity converting retinal to retinoic acid (RA), which are similar to those of xCTBP. The mRNAs were present abundantly in kidney and intestine of adult female Xenopus. Interestingly, their T3 binding activities were inhibited by NAD+ and NADH but not by NADP+ and NADPH, whereas NAD+ was required for their ALDH activities. Our results demonstrate that xCTBP is identical to ALDH1 and suggest that this protein might modulate RA synthesis and intracellular level of free T3.

14603268|t|The selective serotonin-2A receptor antagonist M100907 reverses behavioral deficits in dopamine transporter knockout mice.
14603268|a|A hyperdopaminergic state in humans has been hypothesized to contribute to the pathology of a number of psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Mice that display elevated synaptic levels of dopamine due to a genetically engineered deletion of the dopamine transporter (DAT) model behavioral deficits that simulate the above conditions. As novel treatment strategies for these disorders have focused on the serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptor, we determined the capacity of the highly selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist M100907 to reverse behavioral deficits in DAT knockout (KO) mice. Prior to drug treatment, DAT KO mice exhibited increased levels of locomotor activity and highly linearized movement in a novel environment, as well as reduced prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle, compared to wild-type littermates. Treatment with M100907 (0.3-1.0 mg/kg, but not 0.1 mg/kg) reversed locomotor deficits in DAT KO mice. Similarly, treatment with 1.0 mg/kg M100907 reversed the PPI deficits in DAT KO mice. These data indicate that selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists, such as M100907, may represent a class of drugs that can be used to treat conditions in which a chronic, elevated dopaminergic tone is present and contributes to abnormal behavior and sensorimotor gating deficits.
