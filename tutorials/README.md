# Snorkel Tutorials

We currently provide two tutorials to get you started with Snorkel.

### Intro Tutorial

In this tutorial, we go over the basics of Snorkel by 
building an application to identify mentions of spouses in a corpus 
of news articles. We keep this one well manicured.


### CDR Tutorial

For a more advanced tutorial, check out the CDR tutorial, where
we build an application to extract chemical-disease relations
from academic literature. We check that it runs end-to-end using
automatic testing, but it's also under active development so
you may run into small issues along the way. So it goes with 
real-world information extraction!
