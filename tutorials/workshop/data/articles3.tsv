Source: News Limited  \n        \n A BRINSMEAD man who dissolved his wife in acid is considering taking his bid for freedom to the highest court in Australia.  \n   \nIt has been almost two years since Klaus Andres, 71, was handed a life sentence for the 2011 killing of wife Li Ping Cao. \n\nThroughout his December 2013 trial he admitted to dissolving her body in acid, but said her death beforehand had been an accident. \n\nHe launched an appeal against his sentence, but earlier this month that was dismissed by the Queensland Supreme Court. \n\nAndres is still facing a further six minor charges including interference with a corpse and fraud related to the use of his wife’s credit card. \n\nThose charges were mentioned in the Cairns Magistrates Court yesterday where defence solicitor Stephen O’Reilly said they had virtually been stalled as they were reliant on the outcome of a possible High Court appeal. \n \n“We remain essentially in a holding pattern,” he said. \n\n“He is awaiting advice on leave to appeal to the High Court. \n\n“(The summary charges) formed part of the factual matrix of the murder.” \n\nSpeaking outside court, Mr O’Reilly said he was unsure if Andres would lodge the appeal and he was no longer his legal representative. \n\n“I’ve written to him to explain to him his options, but I’m not acting for him (at the moment),” he said. \n\n“I’m awaiting further instructions.” \n\nThere is no guarantee the case will be heard by the High Court and those wishing to appeal their sentence must attend a preliminary hearing to persuade the court there are special reasons for it to be heard. \n\nIf Andres’ case is heard, that court’s decision will be final with no other avenue of appeal available. \n\nHe argued in his Queensland Supreme Court appeal that a letter from Centrelink tendered by the prosecution during the trial would “infer intent or premeditation”. \n\nThe letter, typed after his wife’s death, requested that her carer payments be transferred to his account. \n\nBut the appeal was dismissed with the three presiding judges agreeing there was no way Andres had not intended to kill his wife. \n\nAndres is currently serving his sentence in Lotus Glen Correctional Centre. The six minor charges have been adjourned until December 14.
0004_4233a2bb-4611-4993-9fe4-da863fe62488	"Mobsters and the movies have been pulling jobs together for nearly a century now, and audiences have been all too happy to aid and abet since the days of ""Little Caesar"" and ""The Public Enemy"" in 1931. We sure love a gangster tale. On some level, we admire the moxie it takes to exploit the American Dream with such ruthlessly single-minded purpose -- and hey, what's a few casually cruel murders along the way? For all his eclecticism, Johnny Depp clearly has the gangster bug, returning to the criminal milieu every few years, in ""Donnie Brasco"" (1997), ""Blow"" (2001), ""Public Enemies"" (2009), and now ""Black Mass,"" which opens in theaters Friday, September 18. ""Crazy Heart"" writer-director Scott Cooper helmed the drama, based on the 2000 book Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, which tells the sordid tale of Whitey Bulger, a merciless South Boston mobster who collaborated with the Feds to bring down his Italian rivals. Following are nine more captivating criminal characterizations of America's Most Wanted and the books and other source material that inspired them. \n \n""American Gangster"" (2007) \nOscar-winning screenwriter Steven Zaillian (""Schindler's List"") turned Mark Jacobson's 2000 New York magazine article "" The Return of Superfly ,"" about 1970s-era New York City heroin kingpin Frank Lucas, into a very successful crime drama directed by Ridley Scott. The most impressive thing about Lucas (played by Denzel Washington) and his hundred-million-dollar empire is how ingenious and shrewd his business strategies were, with the ""American"" in the title nodding appropriately to a guy who embraced and embodied the capitalist spirit as well as any legit entrepreneur. \n \n""White Heat"" (1949) \nThis classic noir starring James Cagney was inspired by any number of real hoods and crimes that took place in the 1920s and '30s, including Francis ""Two Gun"" Crowley, a New York City criminal who was captured and executed at age nineteen. Cagney's unhinged Cody Jarrett has to orchestrate a prison escape, manage treachery inside his gang and his marriage, outrun the Feds, and avenge the murder of his beloved Ma, before going out in one of the greatest film finales ever devised. \n \n""Public Enemies"" (2009) \nMichael Mann (""The Insider"") co-wrote and directed this three-fer based on Bryan Burrough's 2004 book , Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34 , which details the war J. Edgar Hoover and his G-Men waged on John Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, and Baby Face Nelson in 1930s Chicago. As usual, Mann brings a confident, meticulous authenticity to the tone and locations, and the all-star cast -- Depp, Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard -- mount grounded depictions of the real people that defined a dark, exciting chapter of American gangsterism, an era that fed Hollywood crime films and was informed by them in return. \n \n""Scarface"" (1932) / ""The Untouchables"" (1987) \nPaul Muni is brutal mob boss Tony Camonte in the classic Howard Hawks-directed adaptation of Armitage Trail's 1929 novel, inspired by the rise and fall of real-life Chicago mob boss Al Capone. Oscar winner Ben Hecht (""Notorious"") wrote the script. Half a century later, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Mamet based his Brian De Palma-directed screenplay on the autobiographical book by Oscar Fraley and federal agent Eliot Ness, who waged a bloody crusade to bring down Capone during Prohibition (this time played by Robert De Niro). \n \n""Boardwalk Empire"" (2010-14) \nSteve Buscemi won a Golden Globe for his nuanced portrayal of real-life politician-turned-racketeer Enoch ""Nucky"" Johnson, the central figure in HBO's popular Prohibition Era crime saga, which was based on the 2002 book Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City by New Jersey Superior Court judge Nelson Johnson. Created by award-winning ""Sopranos"" writer Terence Winter and launching with a pilot directed by Martin Scorsese, the man who's most defined the post-modern cinema gangster, this series was in artful creative hands from the start. Its five seasons provided plenty of gritty graft-filled drama that showed just how the criminal element can become an essential part of a fledgling city's DNA. \n \n""GoodFellas"" (1990) / ""Casino"" (1995) \nScorsese and author Nicholas Pileggi crafted two instant-classic late-era mob sagas, the former based on Pileggi's 1985 book Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family , the latter on his 1995 work Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas -- both fully describing the gangster culture with precise detail, the vicious logic of violence, and witty pitch-black humor. Both are inspired by real people and real events of certain renown in the annals of crime, and whether it all actually happened like that or not, the actors and filmmakers have us completely convinced that it did. \n \n""Gangs of New York"" (2002) \nHerbert Asbury's 1927 book, The Gangs of New York, details the violent, squalid history of the mid-nineteenth-century New York underbelly, which screenwriters Steven Zaillian, Kenneth Lonergan, and Jay Cocks reworked into a brutal birth-of-America story, also directed by Scorsese. Nominated for ten Oscars, the expansive epic nails the squalor and cynicism of the time, and provides Daniel Day-Lewis the opportunity to create one of the greatest villains ever in knife-wielding gang leader Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting. \n \n\n \nThe post Mobsters With Moxie: 'Black Mass' & 9 More Great Gangster Flicks appeared first on Word and Film ."
0005_03972378-ca38-4c0d-84fa-344215865b84	WASHINGTON:  US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter offered assurances Friday that the Iran nuclear deal will leave Washington with a “more effective” military option if that becomes necessary. \n \nCarter defended the agreement in an opinion piece in USA Today, arguing it would lead to a more durable outcome. \n \nBut the Pentagon chief said the military option was still on the table and, if called for, such action would be “more effective” as a result of the agreement. \n \nWorld powers and Iran struck the landmark deal in July after years of negotiations to address Western concerns that Tehran was developing a nuclear bomb. \n \nRead: Pentagon chief meets Israel PM to discuss tensions over Iran deal \n \n“Its implementation will block the pathways Iran could take to build a nuclear bomb. That long-term outcome is more durable than one a military strike would bring about,” Carter wrote. \n \n“While I am responsible for that alternative and know that it would be effective at setting back Iran’s nuclear programme, it would do so with potentially serious second- and third-order repercussions, and the likely need to repeat attacks once Iran sought to rebuild its capability.” \n \nBut Carter argued the deal also made the option of military action by the US against Iran stronger going forward. \n \nRead: Israeli action against Iran would be ‘huge mistake’: Kerry \n \n“The military option is real today and, as secretary of defense, I will be sure that remains true well into the future,” he wrote. \n \n“Indeed, the reality is that any prospective military option, if called for, will be more effective under this deal — not less. Iran will have a smaller and more concentrated civil nuclear programme, and the deal’s verification provisions will give us more information with which to plan.” \n \nUS President Barack Obama earned enough backing in Congress this week to make sure the deal is not blocked by lawmakers. The agreement will ease Western sanctions on Iran in return for Tehran curtailing its nuclear programme. \n \nRead: Iran, big powers clinch landmark nuclear deal \n \nMany Republicans, however, believe the Islamic republic will still seek to cheat its way to developing an atomic bomb. \n \nA public relations battle was launched over the agreement, which is to be put to a vote in Congress next week. \n \nTehran has steadfastly denied the claims it is developing a nuclear bomb and argued that its nuclear capabilities were for civilian use. \n \nThe post Pentagon chief says Iran deal strengthens US military option appeared first on The Express Tribune .

0009_b7428987-093d-439d-a2f9-c48b0fd99cce	5:52 p.m. EDT \n \nBy Richard Weizel \n \nMILFORD, Conn. (Reuters) - A Connecticut man named as a person of interest in the disappearance of his parents last month was arrested on Tuesday on a federal firearms charge, authorities said. \n \nKyle Navin, 27, of Bridgeport, was charged with possessing a firearm while being a user of illegal drugs, according to Deirdre Daly, U.S. attorney for Connecticut. \n \nHis parents, Jeffrey and Jeanette Navin, were last seen on Aug. 4. A search of the younger Navin's home turned up plastic bags containing heroin residue, hypodermic needles and a receipt from a shooting range dated Aug. 5, prosecutors said in a statement. \n \nJeffrey Navin, 56, the president of waste disposal company J&J Refuse, and his wife, Jeanette, 55, a school paraprofessional, had accumulated more than $2.2 million in debts before they were reported missing by relatives on Aug. 7, police said. \n \nTwo days later, the couple's 2003 Dodge pickup was found in a commuter lot in Westport, Connecticut, off a parkway near Jeffrey Navin's business. Police said a bullet hole and blood were found in the truck. They are investigating whether foul play was involved. \n \nKyle Navin, an operations manager at his father's company, was also missing for about a week after being interviewed by detectives. He was later found staying with friends in Westport. \n \nThe case had initially been treated as a missing persons probe, as friends reported the couple liked to take impromptu vacations. But their lengthy absence led a special state police crime squad to take over the investigation. \n \nIt was not immediately clear if the younger Navin, who was taken into custody, had retained an attorney. \n \nIf convicted of possessing a firearm while being an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance, he could be sentenced to up to 10 years in federal prison. \n \n(Editing by Scott Malone and Peter Cooney)
0010_38a3df1a-126f-4c4f-ba68-154174d0c067	"A roundup of the world's top nightclubs generally reads like a roll call of Europe's ritziest cities, with an obligatory nod to U.S. cities like New York and Los Angeles. Yet nestled in an unassuming strip mall in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico is Hardpop, an electronic dance music oasis with one of the most enthusiastic club-going audiences anywhere - and an equally impressive sound system. After completely re-engineering its sound system with Powersoft power amplifiers earlier this year, Hardpop has emerged from a local favorite to an internationally recognized hotspot for the EDM genre. \n\nBig Dreams \nSince founding the club in 2005, owner Ricardo Tejada grew Hardpop into a lynchpin of the community, but his aspirations did not end there. He wanted Hardpop to bring the world's top DJs to the people of Ciudad Juárez. ""When he started contacting big names about coming to Juárez, a common response was, 'Look, you're going to have to do something really special with your sound system to get us to make the trip."" That's when he reached out to installed sound expert Bill Weir, who knew it would take the unrivaled performance and quality of Powersoft power amplifiers to make Ciudad Juárez a true dance epicenter in the western hemisphere. \n   \nWeir knew that Hardpop's new sound system would have to meet the frequency range demands of contemporary electronica. ""Modern dance music has bottom end that simply did not exist a decade ago,"" Weir says. ""We're being asked to make well-controlled trips into that sub-bass frequency range while maintaining 18 dB of headroom on top of that."" According to Weir, Powersoft was the only manufacturer that could deliver the needed headroom with sufficient clarity and intelligibility across all frequencies. \n\nTejada, who considers himself an audiophile, was immediately onboard for an all-Powersoft overhaul. ""He had just returned from Europe and had heard Powersoft in clubs over there. He realized there was a certain harshness with Hardpop's old system that simply didn't exist in the Powersoft-driven systems,"" Weir recalls. ""Because of its challenging location, Hardpop needed more than just acceptable sound quality. We have to try harder and do more than your average European club. On the amplification side, we needed Powersoft to achieve this."" \n\nA Fully Re-imagined Sound System \nQuality audio performance aside, there was another compelling reason why a Powersoft solution fit like a glove: power upgrades for the building were not an option. Therefore the installation team had to ascertain more output from their sound system with the same current draw. ""Powersoft allowed us to go from 47% efficient to 96% efficient, so we were able to shoehorn another 20 kW without any power system upgrades, which is unbelievable,"" Weir explains. \n\nThe fully re-imagined sound system includes a K8 amplifier for the front subwoofers, a pair of M30D amplifiers for rear subwoofers and four K2 amplifiers for the main speaker cabinets. Additionally an M28Q amplifier powers the stage monitors, with an M50Q amplifier powering the monitor subs. There is also a Powersoft M28Q amplifier, which drives zone fills. Once the installation was complete, Weir made ample use of Powersoft's Armonía software to balance the room with equalization. ""There's no one with better EQ algorithms than Powersoft, and having outboard EQ feels almost unnecessary now,"" he says. \n\nPower to the People -- and the Artists \nThe crowds responded immediately to the Powersoft overhaul, and Weir is proud that the system not only pushes high sound levels, yet respects its listeners' ears. ""This isn't like a bar where people are going to be there for two hours, drink, and then hop to the next place to see the next act,"" Weir explains. ""People get there at 9:00 p.m. and they stay there for 6 to 8 hours sometimes. For that length of time, you've got to be careful of peoples' hearing, and I can achieve a level of subtlety and finesse with Powersoft that I can't get with any other brand."" The Powersoft gear's minuscule physical footprint also leaves plenty of space for the dance floor. ""We've got almost 70 kW RMS in that system and it's all in an 18-space rack with some blanks to spare,"" Weir adds. \n\nThe word is out to artists. Hardpop has hosted renowned DJs such as James Lavelle, Magda, Damian Lazarus, and Deadmau5. ""We have Sasha coming through in a few weeks,"" Weir notes. ""A lot of artists now know about the place because of the level of the sound system."" But Weir says the attention Hardpop's sound system is getting from artists is about more than simple brand-name recognition. ""They know that by having Powersoft behind them, they will be able to make the crowd. Some of the DJs have told us the monitors sound so good they can get a little distracted up there just listening!"" says Weir, laughing. \n\nHope, Sounding Off \nDancing to the pounding rhythms of EDM has proven to be the perfect release for a city that has had more than its share of troubles in recent years. ""When people come out to party on a Saturday night in Ciudad Juárez, it's different than you and I might experience stateside. The energy is escalated to a whole new level."" Weir believes that the venue has encouraged the local population feel more hopeful about the future. ""Hardpop has really helped unify and heal Juárez,"" he concludes. And the DJs who make the trip cannot help but feed off of the positive vibes. ""The combination of the sound system, the venue and the crowd is a totally unique experience,"" says Weir. ""And Powersoft is literally at the center of it."" \n\nAbout Powersoft: \nPowersoft is the world leader in lightweight, high power, single rack space, energy efficient amplifiers for the professional audio market. Founded in Italy in 1995, headquartered in Florence, Italy, with offices in Ventura, CA, Powersoft couples the experience and precision of its production department with exceptional components to deliver products with perfect audio response and high performance reliability.
