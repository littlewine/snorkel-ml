Source: News Limited  \n        \n A BRINSMEAD man who dissolved his wife in acid is considering taking his bid for freedom to the highest court in Australia.  \n   \nIt has been almost two years since Klaus Andres, 71, was handed a life sentence for the 2011 killing of wife Li Ping Cao. \n\nThroughout his December 2013 trial he admitted to dissolving her body in acid, but said her death beforehand had been an accident. \n\nHe launched an appeal against his sentence, but earlier this month that was dismissed by the Queensland Supreme Court. \n\nAndres is still facing a further six minor charges including interference with a corpse and fraud related to the use of his wife’s credit card. \n\nThose charges were mentioned in the Cairns Magistrates Court yesterday where defence solicitor Stephen O’Reilly said they had virtually been stalled as they were reliant on the outcome of a possible High Court appeal. \n \n“We remain essentially in a holding pattern,” he said. \n\n“He is awaiting advice on leave to appeal to the High Court. \n\n“(The summary charges) formed part of the factual matrix of the murder.” \n\nSpeaking outside court, Mr O’Reilly said he was unsure if Andres would lodge the appeal and he was no longer his legal representative. \n\n“I’ve written to him to explain to him his options, but I’m not acting for him (at the moment),” he said. \n\n“I’m awaiting further instructions.” \n\nThere is no guarantee the case will be heard by the High Court and those wishing to appeal their sentence must attend a preliminary hearing to persuade the court there are special reasons for it to be heard. \n\nIf Andres’ case is heard, that court’s decision will be final with no other avenue of appeal available. \n\nHe argued in his Queensland Supreme Court appeal that a letter from Centrelink tendered by the prosecution during the trial would “infer intent or premeditation”. \n\nThe letter, typed after his wife’s death, requested that her carer payments be transferred to his account. \n\nBut the appeal was dismissed with the three presiding judges agreeing there was no way Andres had not intended to kill his wife. \n\nAndres is currently serving his sentence in Lotus Glen Correctional Centre. The six minor charges have been adjourned until December 14.
0004_4233a2bb-4611-4993-9fe4-da863fe62488	"Mobsters and the movies have been pulling jobs together for nearly a century now, and audiences have been all too happy to aid and abet since the days of ""Little Caesar"" and ""The Public Enemy"" in 1931. We sure love a gangster tale. On some level, we admire the moxie it takes to exploit the American Dream with such ruthlessly single-minded purpose -- and hey, what's a few casually cruel murders along the way? For all his eclecticism, Johnny Depp clearly has the gangster bug, returning to the criminal milieu every few years, in ""Donnie Brasco"" (1997), ""Blow"" (2001), ""Public Enemies"" (2009), and now ""Black Mass,"" which opens in theaters Friday, September 18. ""Crazy Heart"" writer-director Scott Cooper helmed the drama, based on the 2000 book Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, which tells the sordid tale of Whitey Bulger, a merciless South Boston mobster who collaborated with the Feds to bring down his Italian rivals. Following are nine more captivating criminal characterizations of America's Most Wanted and the books and other source material that inspired them. \n \n""American Gangster"" (2007) \nOscar-winning screenwriter Steven Zaillian (""Schindler's List"") turned Mark Jacobson's 2000 New York magazine article "" The Return of Superfly ,"" about 1970s-era New York City heroin kingpin Frank Lucas, into a very successful crime drama directed by Ridley Scott. The most impressive thing about Lucas (played by Denzel Washington) and his hundred-million-dollar empire is how ingenious and shrewd his business strategies were, with the ""American"" in the title nodding appropriately to a guy who embraced and embodied the capitalist spirit as well as any legit entrepreneur. \n \n""White Heat"" (1949) \nThis classic noir starring James Cagney was inspired by any number of real hoods and crimes that took place in the 1920s and '30s, including Francis ""Two Gun"" Crowley, a New York City criminal who was captured and executed at age nineteen. Cagney's unhinged Cody Jarrett has to orchestrate a prison escape, manage treachery inside his gang and his marriage, outrun the Feds, and avenge the murder of his beloved Ma, before going out in one of the greatest film finales ever devised. \n \n""Public Enemies"" (2009) \nMichael Mann (""The Insider"") co-wrote and directed this three-fer based on Bryan Burrough's 2004 book , Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34 , which details the war J. Edgar Hoover and his G-Men waged on John Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, and Baby Face Nelson in 1930s Chicago. As usual, Mann brings a confident, meticulous authenticity to the tone and locations, and the all-star cast -- Depp, Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard -- mount grounded depictions of the real people that defined a dark, exciting chapter of American gangsterism, an era that fed Hollywood crime films and was informed by them in return. \n \n""Scarface"" (1932) / ""The Untouchables"" (1987) \nPaul Muni is brutal mob boss Tony Camonte in the classic Howard Hawks-directed adaptation of Armitage Trail's 1929 novel, inspired by the rise and fall of real-life Chicago mob boss Al Capone. Oscar winner Ben Hecht (""Notorious"") wrote the script. Half a century later, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Mamet based his Brian De Palma-directed screenplay on the autobiographical book by Oscar Fraley and federal agent Eliot Ness, who waged a bloody crusade to bring down Capone during Prohibition (this time played by Robert De Niro). \n \n""Boardwalk Empire"" (2010-14) \nSteve Buscemi won a Golden Globe for his nuanced portrayal of real-life politician-turned-racketeer Enoch ""Nucky"" Johnson, the central figure in HBO's popular Prohibition Era crime saga, which was based on the 2002 book Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City by New Jersey Superior Court judge Nelson Johnson. Created by award-winning ""Sopranos"" writer Terence Winter and launching with a pilot directed by Martin Scorsese, the man who's most defined the post-modern cinema gangster, this series was in artful creative hands from the start. Its five seasons provided plenty of gritty graft-filled drama that showed just how the criminal element can become an essential part of a fledgling city's DNA. \n \n""GoodFellas"" (1990) / ""Casino"" (1995) \nScorsese and author Nicholas Pileggi crafted two instant-classic late-era mob sagas, the former based on Pileggi's 1985 book Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family , the latter on his 1995 work Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas -- both fully describing the gangster culture with precise detail, the vicious logic of violence, and witty pitch-black humor. Both are inspired by real people and real events of certain renown in the annals of crime, and whether it all actually happened like that or not, the actors and filmmakers have us completely convinced that it did. \n \n""Gangs of New York"" (2002) \nHerbert Asbury's 1927 book, The Gangs of New York, details the violent, squalid history of the mid-nineteenth-century New York underbelly, which screenwriters Steven Zaillian, Kenneth Lonergan, and Jay Cocks reworked into a brutal birth-of-America story, also directed by Scorsese. Nominated for ten Oscars, the expansive epic nails the squalor and cynicism of the time, and provides Daniel Day-Lewis the opportunity to create one of the greatest villains ever in knife-wielding gang leader Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting. \n \n\n \nThe post Mobsters With Moxie: 'Black Mass' & 9 More Great Gangster Flicks appeared first on Word and Film ."
0005_03972378-ca38-4c0d-84fa-344215865b84	WASHINGTON:  US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter offered assurances Friday that the Iran nuclear deal will leave Washington with a “more effective” military option if that becomes necessary. \n \nCarter defended the agreement in an opinion piece in USA Today, arguing it would lead to a more durable outcome. \n \nBut the Pentagon chief said the military option was still on the table and, if called for, such action would be “more effective” as a result of the agreement. \n \nWorld powers and Iran struck the landmark deal in July after years of negotiations to address Western concerns that Tehran was developing a nuclear bomb. \n \nRead: Pentagon chief meets Israel PM to discuss tensions over Iran deal \n \n“Its implementation will block the pathways Iran could take to build a nuclear bomb. That long-term outcome is more durable than one a military strike would bring about,” Carter wrote. \n \n“While I am responsible for that alternative and know that it would be effective at setting back Iran’s nuclear programme, it would do so with potentially serious second- and third-order repercussions, and the likely need to repeat attacks once Iran sought to rebuild its capability.” \n \nBut Carter argued the deal also made the option of military action by the US against Iran stronger going forward. \n \nRead: Israeli action against Iran would be ‘huge mistake’: Kerry \n \n“The military option is real today and, as secretary of defense, I will be sure that remains true well into the future,” he wrote. \n \n“Indeed, the reality is that any prospective military option, if called for, will be more effective under this deal — not less. Iran will have a smaller and more concentrated civil nuclear programme, and the deal’s verification provisions will give us more information with which to plan.” \n \nUS President Barack Obama earned enough backing in Congress this week to make sure the deal is not blocked by lawmakers. The agreement will ease Western sanctions on Iran in return for Tehran curtailing its nuclear programme. \n \nRead: Iran, big powers clinch landmark nuclear deal \n \nMany Republicans, however, believe the Islamic republic will still seek to cheat its way to developing an atomic bomb. \n \nA public relations battle was launched over the agreement, which is to be put to a vote in Congress next week. \n \nTehran has steadfastly denied the claims it is developing a nuclear bomb and argued that its nuclear capabilities were for civilian use. \n \nThe post Pentagon chief says Iran deal strengthens US military option appeared first on The Express Tribune .

(Reuters) - A Connecticut man named as a person of interest in the disappearance of his parents last month was arrested on Tuesday on a federal firearms charge, authorities said. \n \nKyle Navin, 27, of Bridgeport, was charged with possessing a firearm while being a user of illegal drugs, according to Deirdre Daly, U.S. attorney for Connecticut. \n \nHis parents, Jeffrey and Jeanette Navin, were last seen on Aug. 4. A search of the younger Navin's home turned up plastic bags containing heroin residue, hypodermic needles and a receipt from a shooting range dated Aug. 5, prosecutors said in a statement. \n \nJeffrey Navin, 56, the president of waste disposal company J&J Refuse, and his wife, Jeanette, 55, a school paraprofessional, had accumulated more than $2.2 million in debts before they were reported missing by relatives on Aug. 7, police said. \n \nTwo days later, the couple's 2003 Dodge pickup was found in a commuter lot in Westport, Connecticut, off a parkway near Jeffrey Navin's business. Police said a bullet hole and blood were found in the truck. They are investigating whether foul play was involved. \n \nKyle Navin, an operations manager at his father's company, was also missing for about a week after being interviewed by detectives. He was later found staying with friends in Westport. \n \nThe case had initially been treated as a missing persons probe, as friends reported the couple liked to take impromptu vacations. But their lengthy absence led a special state police crime squad to take over the investigation. \n \nIt was not immediately clear if the younger Navin, who was taken into custody, had retained an attorney. \n \nIf convicted of possessing a firearm while being an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance, he could be sentenced to up to 10 years in federal prison. \n \n(Editing by Scott Malone and Peter Cooney)
0010_38a3df1a-126f-4c4f-ba68-154174d0c067	"A roundup of the world's top nightclubs generally reads like a roll call of Europe's ritziest cities, with an obligatory nod to U.S. cities like New York and Los Angeles. Yet nestled in an unassuming strip mall in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico is Hardpop, an electronic dance music oasis with one of the most enthusiastic club-going audiences anywhere - and an equally impressive sound system. After completely re-engineering its sound system with Powersoft power amplifiers earlier this year, Hardpop has emerged from a local favorite to an internationally recognized hotspot for the EDM genre. \n\nBig Dreams \nSince founding the club in 2005, owner Ricardo Tejada grew Hardpop into a lynchpin of the community, but his aspirations did not end there. He wanted Hardpop to bring the world's top DJs to the people of Ciudad Juárez. ""When he started contacting big names about coming to Juárez, a common response was, 'Look, you're going to have to do something really special with your sound system to get us to make the trip."" That's when he reached out to installed sound expert Bill Weir, who knew it would take the unrivaled performance and quality of Powersoft power amplifiers to make Ciudad Juárez a true dance epicenter in the western hemisphere. \n   \nWeir knew that Hardpop's new sound system would have to meet the frequency range demands of contemporary electronica. ""Modern dance music has bottom end that simply did not exist a decade ago,"" Weir says. ""We're being asked to make well-controlled trips into that sub-bass frequency range while maintaining 18 dB of headroom on top of that."" According to Weir, Powersoft was the only manufacturer that could deliver the needed headroom with sufficient clarity and intelligibility across all frequencies. \n\nTejada, who considers himself an audiophile, was immediately onboard for an all-Powersoft overhaul. ""He had just returned from Europe and had heard Powersoft in clubs over there. He realized there was a certain harshness with Hardpop's old system that simply didn't exist in the Powersoft-driven systems,"" Weir recalls. ""Because of its challenging location, Hardpop needed more than just acceptable sound quality. We have to try harder and do more than your average European club. On the amplification side, we needed Powersoft to achieve this."" \n\nA Fully Re-imagined Sound System \nQuality audio performance aside, there was another compelling reason why a Powersoft solution fit like a glove: power upgrades for the building were not an option. Therefore the installation team had to ascertain more output from their sound system with the same current draw. ""Powersoft allowed us to go from 47% efficient to 96% efficient, so we were able to shoehorn another 20 kW without any power system upgrades, which is unbelievable,"" Weir explains. \n\nThe fully re-imagined sound system includes a K8 amplifier for the front subwoofers, a pair of M30D amplifiers for rear subwoofers and four K2 amplifiers for the main speaker cabinets. Additionally an M28Q amplifier powers the stage monitors, with an M50Q amplifier powering the monitor subs. There is also a Powersoft M28Q amplifier, which drives zone fills. Once the installation was complete, Weir made ample use of Powersoft's Armonía software to balance the room with equalization. ""There's no one with better EQ algorithms than Powersoft, and having outboard EQ feels almost unnecessary now,"" he says. \n\nPower to the People -- and the Artists \nThe crowds responded immediately to the Powersoft overhaul, and Weir is proud that the system not only pushes high sound levels, yet respects its listeners' ears. ""This isn't like a bar where people are going to be there for two hours, drink, and then hop to the next place to see the next act,"" Weir explains. ""People get there at 9:00 p.m. and they stay there for 6 to 8 hours sometimes. For that length of time, you've got to be careful of peoples' hearing, and I can achieve a level of subtlety and finesse with Powersoft that I can't get with any other brand."" The Powersoft gear's minuscule physical footprint also leaves plenty of space for the dance floor. ""We've got almost 70 kW RMS in that system and it's all in an 18-space rack with some blanks to spare,"" Weir adds. \n\nThe word is out to artists. Hardpop has hosted renowned DJs such as James Lavelle, Magda, Damian Lazarus, and Deadmau5. ""We have Sasha coming through in a few weeks,"" Weir notes. ""A lot of artists now know about the place because of the level of the sound system."" But Weir says the attention Hardpop's sound system is getting from artists is about more than simple brand-name recognition. ""They know that by having Powersoft behind them, they will be able to make the crowd. Some of the DJs have told us the monitors sound so good they can get a little distracted up there just listening!"" says Weir, laughing. \n\nHope, Sounding Off \nDancing to the pounding rhythms of EDM has proven to be the perfect release for a city that has had more than its share of troubles in recent years. ""When people come out to party on a Saturday night in Ciudad Juárez, it's different than you and I might experience stateside. The energy is escalated to a whole new level."" Weir believes that the venue has encouraged the local population feel more hopeful about the future. ""Hardpop has really helped unify and heal Juárez,"" he concludes. And the DJs who make the trip cannot help but feed off of the positive vibes. ""The combination of the sound system, the venue and the crowd is a totally unique experience,"" says Weir. ""And Powersoft is literally at the center of it."" \n\nAbout Powersoft: \nPowersoft is the world leader in lightweight, high power, single rack space, energy efficient amplifiers for the professional audio market. Founded in Italy in 1995, headquartered in Florence, Italy, with offices in Ventura, CA, Powersoft couples the experience and precision of its production department with exceptional components to deliver products with perfect audio response and high performance reliability. Its state-of-the-art amplifiers can be found in an array of markets, ranging from stadiums, sporting arenas, theme parks, performance venues and airports to convention centers, churches and clubs, and are used by the world's leading tour sound companies.

0012_51c954ea-d874-4b6c-8aee-8c16a06487dc	Julio Medem ’s filmography includes some of the most distinctive titles of 90s Spanish cinema, but his two features since 2000’s Sex and Lucia -- Chaotic Ana and Room in Rome -- were at best uneven. Ma Ma  maintains the focus on women, but does little to quell the doubts about Medem’s career trajectory. Looking rather like the unveiling of a new, audience-friendly, non-provocative Medem who’s hesitant about whether to follow the market or his muse, Ma Ma features a melodramatically weepie story line; elegant, fashion catalog design; dreams of soccer glory; and Penelope Cruz as a young mother battling breast cancer. \n \nWhat could possibly go wrong? Well, Cruz’s aces performance apart, very little about this extremely disappointing film feels real, and some of it is risible. But presales have been strong, driven presumably by the presence of Cruz, and it’s facile message, expressed more concisely by Eric Idle at the end of Life of Brian , might mean that Ma Ma ’s world of fake emotion could indeed work well for the younger, more impressionable demographic. \n \nIn the opening scenes, unemployed Magda (Cruz, doing her considerable best in a film she co-produced) is diagnosed as having breast cancer, for which she’s being treated by gynecologist Julian ( Asier Etxeandia ), a dreamy, soft-spoken chap with unlimited time available to deal with his patients. In the stands at a soccer game, watching her talented son Dani ( Teo Planell ), she meets soccer scout Arturo ( Luis Tosar ), who receives the news that there’s been a car crash involving his wife and son. \n \nA friendship develops between Magda and Arturo, based on mutual emotional support: Dani’s Raul ( Alex Brendemuhl ) is an implausibly callous philosophy teacher who’s scarcely to be seen. Soon it will fall to Julian to reveal that her cancer is terminal: she starts having mysterious dreams of a pale girl in snow, walking dreamily towards camera. \n \nJulian, meanwhile, is that rare beast, a doctor who sings 70s Spanish pop songs to his patients -- to say the least, an extremely dodgy directorial decision. After the gyno starts warbling over Magda’s bed, Ma Ma never really recovers. It’s a thin line between directorial fearlessness and directorial foolhardiness. \n \nMedem’s early work created distinctive worlds, poetic, eerie and strange. They were driven by their own logic, and bizarre though it sometimes was, they were working in the service of a vision. But here, there is an absence of any comprehensible world or vision, and very little logic. Magda, an unemployed teacher, lives in a great apartment. How come Julian has so much free time? What happens to Dani’s soccer dreams, so crucial at the start? And yes, the continual suggestions that Magda’s illness have isolated her from the world come over loud and clear, but why does she not have even a single female friend? Indeed, a nurse (Silvia Abascal) apart, where are all the women the final credits tell us the film is dedicated to? \n \nWatching Ma Ma is thus an unsettling experience in all sorts of unintended ways. It’s as though Medem, having realized that he’d accidentally written a conventional melodrama, suddenly decided at the shooting stage that he’d have to use style to make it all more interesting. This is clearest when a kiss cuts to medical images of a pulsating heart: and it’s here when the viewer realizes that the director is somewhat questionably using breast cancer as a platform for his art, rather than tackling it with the human sensitivity its subject surely demands. \n \nPerformances are good, but characterization is sketchy. Tosar, one of Spain’s finest and highest-profile character actors, here mostly hangs around weeping or looking glum. If meeting Magda has been some kind of redemption for Arturo, then he’s mostly keeping it to himself: and strangely, these two friends whose lives have been blighted barely openly discuss the elephant in the room. Dani is an off-the-peg son, happy to score winning goals as his proud Mom cheers from the sidelines and ask winning, puzzled questions. \n \nCruz’s best work, as in Pedro Almodovar ’s  Volver and Sergio Castellitto ’s  Don’t Move , has been done in the role of a suffering woman driven by inner dignity. Ma Ma, which offers her something similar, is one of her finest performances, and by some distance she is the strongest thing about it: scatty, forgetful, moody, with a winsome, trusting innocence about her, Magda is a real, rounded woman in an unreal, monodimensional world. It’s the sort of faux philosophical, faux poetic world in which someone muses “We need the sea in summer”, and someone else replies “Yes, if we didn’t, it wouldn’t be summer”. \n \nMa Ma unfolds in varying locations of chilly extraterrestrial paleness, as though it was a melodrama beamed in from Mars. If cancer is a dirty, messy business, physically and emotionally, then very little of it comes over. Beautiful to watch and elegantly designed but remote, there’s the sense that the actors are struggling to give it their gritty, realistic best despite the hyper-stylized setting in which they’ve been placed. Perhaps Medem opted for this stripped-back look to allow the viewers to focus exclusively on the intense emotions at hand, but all it does is distract from them. \n \nThrow in regular, alienating jump-cuts, lovingly-lensed technology, and an occasional close-up of a puzzling symbol -- Magda’s nipple, beautifully preserved on ice as a souvenir, a crab in the sand -- and the viewer's alienation is complete. \n \nProduction companies: Morena Films, Ma Ma Peliculas, Mare Nostrum Productions \nCast: Penelope Cruz, Luis Tosar, Asier Etxeandia, Teo Planell, Silvia Abascal \nDirector, screenwriter: Julio Medem \nProducers: Penelope Cruz, Julio Medem, Alvaro Longoria \nDirector of photography: Kiko de la Rica \nProduction designer: Montse Sanz \nEditors: Julio Medem, Ivan Aledo \nComposer: Alberto Iglesias \nSales: Seville International (Int’l), Creative Artists Agency (US) \n \nPG, 111 minutes

Which NBC TV shows will be cancelled and which will be renewed? Stay tuned! NBC shows this season (so far): A to Z, About a Boy, AD: The Bible Continues: Allegiance, America’s Got Talent, American Ninja Warrior, American Odyssey, Aquarius, Bad Judge, The Biggest Loser, The Blacklist, The Celebrity Apprentice, Chicago Fire, Chicago PD, Constantine, Dateline, Dateline Saturday Night Mystery, Grimm, Hannibal, Hollywood Game Night, I Can Do That, The Island, Last Comic Standing, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Marry Me, Mr. Robinson, The Mysteries of Laura, The Night Shift, One Big Happy, Parenthood, Parks and Recreation, Running Wild with Bear Grylls, The Sing-Off, The Slap, State of Affairs, Undateable, The Voice, and Welcome to Sweden. There’s lots of data that NBC looks at when deciding whether to renew or cancel a TV series but the ratings are typically the biggest piece. Here’s how the network’s shows are doing. Note: If you’re not seeing the updated charts, please try reloading the page. You can also see them here and here. A couple of notes about these charts:\nThese figures are updated automatically as new ratings are released. The averages are based on the final national numbers (live plus same day viewing), unless marked with an asterisk (*). For technical reasons, I have to resort them manually so feel free to let me know if I missed something. Keep in mind that the demo numbers are typically what’s most important to advertisers. Therefore, that’s how the networks measure success. Advertisers pay more for ad time on a show that has a higher demo rating. Because older viewers don’t count? No, it’s because younger viewers watch less traditional TV and are harder to reach. Demo numbers are typically reported using the 10ths decimal place (2.4, for example). In the averages, I’m using an extra decimal for easier ranking. The networks take into account when shows air on Fridays and Saturdays, nights when TV viewership is lower. How are your shows doing? Check the other current rankings:\nABC | CBS | The CW | FOX\nABC Family | AMC | FX | HBO | MTV | Showtime | Syfy | TNT | USA What do you think? Which shows are you rooting for? Which one isn’t as big a hit as you thought? Are you hoping any series will get cancelled to make way for something else?

0017_0a00fbad-9764-4894-ac95-fd53ced8c453	Their relationship isn’t going to the dogs, but Cambridge residents Liz Allen and Jonathan Donaldson hope their wedding reception will. The couple, scheduled to tie the knot Sept. 26 at the Yarmouth New Church on Route 6A, posted an ad on Craigslist asking local owners of bulldogs, pugs or Boston terriers to bring their pets to the outdoor reception immediately after the ceremony. “I didn’t know if anyone would respond,” said Allen. “There’s got to be quite a few people in the area who have—we joke about it—any dog with chops.” The family fascination with jowly breeds began with Donaldson’s son Gus, and quickly spread to daughter Anouk, Donaldson himself, and Allen. “He always liked dogs, but the bulldog obsession started when he was about nine years old,” said Allen. “We just sort of developed this family joke. We have songs we sing about bulldogs.” The couple is hoping to have a lawn filled with dogs to surprise the kids after the wedding. “It’s a little silly, but the wedding is going to be just very casual and fun, with family from all over the country,” said Allen. “I think they’d just love the surprise of, they come out of the church, and there’s just all these bulldogs around.” “It’s the kind of place where any kind of wedding can happen,” said Humberto Cordero, a member of the Yarmouth New Church Preservation Foundation. “It’s a kind of all-takers venue for events of all sorts, because it’s not a church. But it is a church. That’s the wonderful thing about it.” Cordero, a friend of the couple who will also officiate the wedding, suggested the unique building, formerly the home of Yarmouth’s Swedenborgian congregation, now a secular venue for art exhibits, musical performances, and all manner of other events. He said ideas like the couple’s bulldog reception fit well with the New Church’s openness to ceremonies of all kinds. “We take the weird or the very straight,” Cordero said. “It’s a very flexible space. For the people who are looking for a storybook wedding, it’s sort of a storybook part of the Cape. It’s a very unique spot. I don’t think there’s anything like it on the Cape.” Cordero said he hopes people respond to the couple’s invitation. “It’ll be interesting as they come out of the church, as they come down the steps, whether we’re going to have a little doggy party. That would be an interesting way to end the day.” Page 2 of 2 - So far Allen and Donaldson have received one RSVP. Barnstable resident Callalilly Finglas will be in attendance, along with her pug Hugsley. “It sounded like a cute idea, and I always like to try and help out,” said Finglas. “It just seemed like a positive thing to do. I love meeting new people.” Hugsley, too, is gregarious. “She’s social,” said Finglas. “When she’s talking to someone and likes them, she’ll roll over on her back.” The family doesn’t have a dog of its own, but the possibility of receiving one as a wedding present in light of the reception’s theme has occurred to Allen. “We live in a really small place, and we thought about getting one,” she said. “If we got one, we would be thrilled. I don’t quite know how we’d manage it in this space, but we’d make it work.” RSVP The invitation for bulldogs, pugs, and Boston terriers to attend the wedding of Liz Allen and Jonathan Donaldson can be found under the pets section of Cape Cod Craigslist. The ceremony takes place Sept. 26 at the Yarmouth New Church , 266 Route 6A, Yarmouth Port.
0018_14325b24-abdf-4ede-8588-62158096afea	"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The Browns took a leap of faith and put Terrelle Pryor on the 53 man roster. \n \nThe 4 p.m deadline for final cuts came and went, and Pryor, who's making the transition from quarterback to receiver, was still standing. \n \nPryor can also serve as the Browns' third quarterback now that they only have Josh McCown and Johnny Manziel on the roster. Backups Thad Lewis and Pat Devlin were among the final cuts. \n \nPryor played quarterback for three seasons in Oakland, including two when current Browns offensive coordinator John DeFilippo was his quarterbacks coach. \n \nTerrance West was not safe heading into the final cuts a source told Northeast Ohio Media Group, but he's still on the team. The Browns engaged in talks with the Cowboys according to Aaron Wilson of the Houston Chronicle, but the Browns were asking to much. \n \nMeanwhile, rookie receiver Vince Mayle, the Browns fourth-round pick out of Washington State, was waived. The Browns will likely try to add him to the practice squad. Mayle struggled in preseason after undergoing thumb surgery in May. He was inconsistent catching the ball and needs time to develop. \n \nRunning back Shaun Draughn was also among the cuts. \n \nCoach Mike Pettine provided some clues that he was leaning toward keeping Pryor after the preseason finale Thursday night in Chicago. That night, Pryor played receiver, quarterback and personal punt protector. \n \n""Anytime you can have a guy that can run, that can throw, that can protect, I just think it changes the mindset defensively a little bit,'' said Pettine, who knows what gives a defense fits. \n \nOn Friday, however, Pettine acknowledged it would be 'a leap of faith' to keep the inexperienced wideout on the team. \n \n""It is a project to take a guy that has played quarterback for the vast majority of his football career,'' said Pettine. ""Even if he had stayed completely healthy, I don't know if we would have all the results in or feel 100 percent comfortable. Even if he had gone the whole time and not gotten injured, it certainly it would be a leap of faith."" \n \nPryor -- who missed most of camp with a strained hamstring -- didn't have a pass thrown his way that night, but he ran his routes with authority, he proved a tenacious blocker and ran the read-option twice, keeping the ball both times for runs of 5 and 4 yards. When his 15-18 snaps were up, his 4.5-yard rushing average was tops on the team, better than West's 3.9-yard average on his nine carries. \n \n""To be out there competing against different guys and getting my chance to put my hands on different guys -- guys who aren't our teammates -- I had a good time,'' said Pryor. \n \nLewis said of Pryor after the game, ""the guy has a knack for football. He's physically gifted, so he has the opportunity to be great. He just has to keep working at it.'' \n \nBefore the game, Pryor stressed that he didn't want anything handed to him. He worked hard at his new craft in the month leading up to camp, training at the Randy Moss Academy in North Carolina with other top receivers. \n \n""I don't want to feel blessed,'' Pryor said. ""Everything I've ever done for my life, sheesh, my mother, growing up I've been by myself, moving in and out of different places by myself since I was 12 years old. I really didn't have like a figure, people to show me the way. I've pretty much grown and anything I have I've worked for it by myself. \n \n""I don't like being given anything. I do want to help the Browns. If that's the opportunity I have, cool, but that doesn't excite me. That doesn't say I've worked for it. When I get on the field I'd say I'm a great teammate. I spend a long time in the facility, I always ask questions, I try to be the best teammate, player I can be. But that doesn't excite me because I want to earn everything I have or get.'' \n \nPryor also has no regrets about waiting so long to give up on his quarterback dreams and try receiver. He spent three years as a quarterback in Oakland from 2011-2012 and sat out of football in 2014. \n \n""You can't have regrets and you can't look back,'' he said. ""I definitely don't look back in the past because I've been cut three times. This doesn't hurt me mentally. All I can do is look forward and enjoy this time I've been having, having great coaches coach me up every single day, having great teammates right now here in the present. Being a Cleveland Brown, I enjoy it, I love it.'' \n \nPryor was grateful he had earned the respect of cornerbacks Joe Haden and Tramon Williams before going down with the hamstring injury Aug. 4th. \n \n""It means a lot,'' he said. ""The feeling for me to have a guy like Joe Haden, Dwayne Bowe and guys like that to speak up for me on my behalf. It doesn't get any better than that. You've got Joe Haden, guys you go against and he kind of sees your potential. I appreciate that from Joe, I really do appreciate him and appreciate all my teammates.'' \n \nHaden, for one,  was confident other teams would've given Pryor a chance at receiver if the Browns had given up on him.  Now, he'll get to go against him in practice every day and help him become an NFL receiver. \n \nOther Browns cut today include receiver Josh Lenz, defensive linemen Jacobbi McDaniel and Dylan Wynn, cornerback Joe Rankin, cornerback Robert Nelson Jr. and offense lineman Andrew McDonald."
0019_f0f25297-98b6-4bb7-9d67-966f64ab3e75	Fans are torn about the possibility of Gloucester Rugby being passed into overseas hands after an Australian consortium offered £20million for the club. \n \nA group of businessmen from Down Under are one of five possible new owners for the Cherry and Whites, who have been up for sale since April. \n \nSerious interest in the club is being shown within England, Europe and Japan. A deal could be concluded within a couple of weeks. \n \nMajor shareholders Ryan Walkinshaw and Martin St Quinton are understood to be looking for at least £25million for the club, which is one of the few professional rugby clubs to turn a profit. \n \nFans were split on whether the club should be foreign-owned. \n \nGary Teague, landlord of Teague’s Bar opposite Kingsholm, said new investment could take Gloucester Rugby to greater things on the field. \n \nHe said: “A cash injection is what the club needs to take it to the next level. A lot of clubs are spending big and the investment could secure our future in the Premiership. We don’t want to end up like Bristol. \n \n“The new owners need to take Gloucester to the Saracens level.” \n \nIvan Taylor, chairman of the Westgate Traders’ Association, earlier this year campaigned for fans to pull together and buy the club. \n \nHe said: “The new ownership needs to secure the ground for the future and not use it as a toy to make profit. \n \n“Hopefully the new owners will have a plan that improves the club and carries on the traditions of Kingsholm. \n \n“If we had 20,000 people wanting to get involved then buying the club could be achievable. We would have to raise £25million, which is no mean feat.” \n \nMr Walkinshaw and Mr St Quinton are not desperate to sell the club and maintain any agreement would be made in the best interests of the club. \n \nBut lifelong Gloucester Rugby fan Chris Collier said he was worried at the prospect of the club being foreign-owned. \n \nHe said: “I’m nervous about the ownership of the club being on the other side of the world. What would they know about the traditions of Gloucester? \n \n“I would prefer a local consortium of businesses to take over. The city is rugby mad and it’s unique.” \n\nGloucester Rugby and its owners will meet with agents of contenders in the next few weeks.
0020_ac9c985a-79d1-40a0-906a-ef4de1240765	"Court of Appeal says jury acted ""unreasonably"" in defamation case against broadcaster Ray Hadley, and parts of the case should be re-tried. \n\nBroadcaster Ray Hadley has won a partial victory in a defamation case brought against him by a Sydney fish and chip shop owner, with the Court of Appeal ordering parts of the case be re-tried and suggesting the original damages payout was ""excessive"".\n\nAfter a lengthy trial in late 2013, a Supreme Court jury found the 2GB host defamed Kim Ahmed in two broadcasts and rejected his defence of honest opinion.\n\nBut the Court of Appeal - Justices Ruth McColl, John Basten and Anthony Meagher - ruled on Thursday that some of the jury's findings were ""unreasonable"" and ordered a retrial of part of the case.\n\nThe ruling leaves intact some of the jury's findings but may result in a reduced damages award once the retrial has been heard.\n\nHadley delivered two attacks against Ms Ahmed in 2008 and 2009 for supporting her husband after he was convicted of indecently assaulting a 17-year-old female staff member in the shop's cool room in January 2007.\n\nHe described Ms Ahmed as a ""grub"" and a ""silly, silly woman"" and called on listeners to put the couple's shop out of business.\n\nActing Supreme Court Justice Henric Nicholas . But the Court of Appeal said the jury had acted unreasonably in characterising Hadley's statements as fact rather than opinion, which was fatal to his defence of honest opinion.\n\nDuring one of the broadcasts, Hadley took aim at Ms Ahmed for taking out an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) against the father of the teenage assault victim for allegedly stalking and intimidating her.\n\nThe broadcast was found to convey that the AVO application was false, vexatious and frivolous.\n\nThe court said the jury's finding that Hadley's remarks about the AVO were ""statements of fact and not expressions of opinion was unreasonable and should be set aside"".\n\nIt ordered a retrial so a new jury can consider whether Hadley's opinion was based on material that was substantially true, which is one of the requirements of the defence.\n\nThe court found the jury had also mischaracterised a suggestion Ms Ahmed was a ""low, contemptible person"" as a statement of fact, and it will be considered in the retrial.\n\nIt left the jury's findings about other meanings intact, including that Hadley had no defence to claims Ms Ahmed was ""silly woman"" and that she ""condones and does not object to the criminal conduct of her husband"".\n\nBut it noted the trial judge had awarded $40,000 solely in respect of the imputation Ms Ahmed was a ""silly woman"" and said it was ""arguable"" this was ""excessive"".\n\nDamages will be decided by the judge presiding over the retrial. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald."

But his girlfriend revealed on his Facebook page that they had been making wedding plans.\n\n""Thats my man lookin fresh as always ,,, babie i cant wait to marry you!!! As soon as ur out im gunna make u my husband,xxxx,"" she wrote.\n\nWiles, who recorded a rap song, Time To Rise, under the name BEAUJANGLZ in 2012, also kept his family and friends up to date with what he was doing, and eating, while in jail.\n\n""Just finished in the gym having a tuna and bake beans the good stuff u know it ... "" he posted at the start of the month.\n\nOn Wednesday morning police began a search for Wiles, who was described as being 180 centimetres tall, 100 kilograms, with tattoos on his lower forearms.\n\nA Facebook friend urged him to hand himself in to police.\n\n""Brother please hand ur self in to police now its only jail the is bad beau they will kill u shoot u dead please bro go back to police now please I beg u beau,"" the poster wrote on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWiles' escape follows that last month of armed bandit Stephen Jamieson, 29, who became the first inmate to escape from Goulburn's maximum security section in 19 years.\n\nJamieson used bed sheets he had tied together to scale the prison walls, and, with a pillow strapped to his waist, manouevred over the razor wire to freedom.\n\nHe was on the run for 12 hours before he was recaptured by police following a pursuit in south-west Sydney.\n\nJamieson was already being held in segregation following suspicions he was behind a man-made hole found on prison grounds earlier in August.\n\nNSW Opposition Leader Luke Foley said it was not good enough that there had been five prison breaks already in 2015-16\n\n""Corrective Services Minister David Elliott is single-handedly solving the overcrowding crisis in NSW prisons by letting inmates stroll out the front gate,"" Mr Foley said.\n\n""Under Elliott's watch, inmates even have the luxury of bragging about their escape plans on Facebook.

0022_20c239b1-b016-42bd-bd92-a5f44727e878	"\n\n \n \n\t \nThat's not how it's done in the NHL anymore. When the Penguins practice Sunday at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, there's more likely to be a lightning strike than a fight. \n\n""œNow they forbid you,""� said Francois Leroux, a giant 6-foot-6 enforcer for the Penguins from 1994-97 who retired from pro hockey in 2008. ""œEven toward my last training camps, coaches said, ""˜Guys, save it for the other teams.' ""� \n\nBut that's how it was done in the NHL for decades. Those who made their living with their fists knew they had to make an impression. \n\n""œYou had to establish yourselves, and there's always someone new on the block who's trying to climb the rope,""� said Dave Hanson, who racked up 2,548 penalty minutes in a 10-year pro career in addition to starring in ""œSlap Shot""� as one of the Hanson brothers. ""œThey have to establish themselves and set a tone too.""� \n\nLess squaring up \n\nThese days, fights are almost as rare in the regular season as they are in training camp scrimmages. \n\nTeams have averaged .38 and .32 fights per game over the past two seasons. That's the first time there have been back-to-back seasons with fewer than .40 fights per team per game since 1968-70. \n\nThe Penguins reflect those changes. \n\nThey had 33 fighting majors last season, tied for third most in the league, but most of the players responsible for those bouts have departed via trade or free agency. The 20 players projected to be in the starting lineup on opening night combined for just four fights in a Penguins jersey last season: one each for Crosby, Kris Letang, Ian Cole and Rob Scuderi. \n\nThere's a chance the Penguins could shake up those stats if agitating winger Bobby Farnham becomes a lineup regular or if heavyweight tryout Tom Sestito sticks, but it's not likely. The Penguins will deal with misbehaving opponents in other ways. \n\nEven assistant coach Rick Tocchet, who had 156 fighting majors in 18 NHL seasons, acknowledges that. \n\n""œWe have a team that's fast. We have a lot of guys that can score,""� Tocchet said. ""œThat's a great detriment to people playing a little too aggressive or too chippy with each other.""� \n\nMirroring the trend \n\nThere's a perception that it has always been that way in the Penguins organization, that the team has preferred to play a beautiful game and serve its revenge on a power-play platter. \n\nThat's not entirely true. \n\nWhen fighting became fashionable during the 1970s, with expansion diluting the talent pool and the Philadelphia Flyers having championship success with their Broad Street Bullies, the Penguins followed suit with the likes of Battleship Kelly, Steve Durbano and Bryan Watson. \n\nWhen the game took another turn for the rough and tumble in the 1980s, the Penguins again kept pace. Led by Paul Baxter, Gary Rissling and Marty McSorley, they exceeded the league average in fights per game for three straight seasons from 1981-84. \n\nFive years ago, aided by a pair of brawls with the New York Islanders, the Penguins had nearly double the league average of fights per game. \n\nIn other words, from Dave ""œThe Hammer""� Schultz to Georges Laraque, Penguins history is littered with colorful characters who knew how to fight. \n\n""œEven when Mario (Lemieux) was there, there were some pretty tough cookies there,""� Hanson said. ""œYou had (Kevin Stevens). You had Tocchet. They were a tough team.""� \n\nThey still may be a tough team, but the definition of toughness has changed. Now it might be about taking a hit to make a play or persevering through bumps and bruises to stay in the lineup. \n\nThe days of players proving their toughness through fistfights ""” whether against teammates in training camp scrimmages or opponents in games that count ""” look to be numbered. \n\n""œThe game's changing. A lot of people like to say, ""˜It would be better like this or it would be better like that,' but it's changing.

0023_3381e84b-3ba0-4283-81b7-93a39883af2e	Sergeant Amy Mills is busy. Not so busy that she can’t spare some time to talk about the job that she loves, but her brisk gait and purposeful demeanor are an instant giveaway that she’s a woman on a mission. And that mission—to resolve the backlog of rape kits in Dallas—is a job so monumental that most of us wouldn’t even know where to begin. But despite the obvious magnitude of the project, the Dallas Police Department Sex Assault Unit, under Mills’ leadership, has submitted 2,356 kits for laboratory testing since last August. This is a significant dent in a logjam that consists of 4,140 sets of evidence, all of which had been gathering dust in DPD’s property room until late last year. \n\nThose 4,140 kits represent much more than the evidence inside them: they represent lives in limbo. Assembling them requires re-traumatizing sexual assault victims, who have to undergo an intensive examination by a nurse certified in evidence retrieval. Once medically stabilized, victims spend somewhere in the neighborhood of an hour under harsh lights being probed and swabbed and plucked and photographed in a process that is demeaning and painful. Sergeant Mills is adamant that this process should never be in vain. “If you endure that invasive exam when all you want to do is take a shower, brush your teeth—take a drink of water, even…then we owe it to you to process that evidence, to be an advocate for you, and to let you have some sense of closure.” \n\nMills makes it clear that the backlogged kits didn’t stay untested due to negligence or lack of regard toward crime victims. In fact, DPD is one of the few departments that keeps evidence past the statute of limitations—the property room actually has rape kits that date back 30 years. But for a variety of reasons, too large a number remained untouched. Sometimes, the survivors weren’t willing or able to participate in investigations. Funding and personnel limitations were often a factor. And, Mills says, investigators have only recently begun to understand the full evidentiary value of the kits. Obviously, justice for the victim of the assault is a driving factor, but there’s an element of prevention to be pursued, also. Sexual assault perpetrators are rarely one-time offenders. Mills details burglary cases, domestic assaults, sex offenses, even murders that were solved by evidence obtained from a single rape kit. “We’re finding out how intertwined these crimes are,” she says, “It’s amazing how one victim’s evidence can link us to so many other investigative leads.” \n\nThe rape kit issue became a national one when an assistant prosecutor in Detroit, Kym Worthy, brought to light that over 11,000 kits had been untested in that jurisdiction; a number of advocacy organizations took notice and began to raise funds to end that backlog and others across the nation. As a result of the increased attention, a grant was made through the Texas Department of Public Safety to fund Dallas PD’s efforts to test the cases—at approximately $500 a piece. The money will allow testing back to 1996, and Mills is hopeful she can eventually go back further. \n\nWhen the 15-year DPD veteran is told that she’s being included in a list of Dallas’ most brilliant women, Mills demurs. “I just do the work,” she insists. “There’s nothing special about that.” It’s an understatement that she’s done the work—an impressive juggling act involving most nights and weekends between August of 2014 and April of this year. She still had her regular duties as supervisor of seven detectives in the sex assault unit to attend to, so she’d come in at 6 a.m. and tackle a case or two, then stay late and plow through as many as she could. Each case is painstaking to review: files are examined thoroughly to determine if the associated evidence is eligible for testing, and if so, they are flagged and categorized so that the lab knows what to look for. In an eight -month period, she determined that over 2,000 of the kits were eligible for submission, amassing untold hours of overtime (“No idea,” she says when asked how much time she logged), occupying her mind during her early morning runs, and waking her up at night. \n\nAt this point, her hard work is having a tangible effect. The tests are coming back from the lab; DNA profiles have been entered in CODIS, the FBI’s national database; and so far over 30 percent have resulted in a match. When those matches occur, Mills triages the cases: some are just confirmations of a case that’s already been adjudicated, so no action is required. Others identify a known suspect who is capable of committing further assaults: Mills puts one of her seven detectives on those cases immediately. She’s confident that retesting that mountain of cases results in prevention of further assaults, particularly when she’s able to affect an arrest. And she also loves being able to call a survivor and tell them that it’s over—that she or he can have peace of mind knowing their assailant can’t do this again. \n\nBeyond arrests and overtime, Mills offers something else to the citizens of Dallas, particularly the women and men victimized by a sexual assault: her efforts and her advocacy change the dialogue about rape. She—and her detectives, who she’s quick to credit for their hard work juggling this project alongside their current cases—make it clear that what has happened to these people matters, regardless of whether the victims are college students or prostitutes; drug addicts or professionals. “People understand that they are not forgotten; that they didn’t endure this for nothing. Ultimately, I think this means that more people will report these types of crimes because they know that we believe them. They know now that we want to give them peace of mind and to do everything we can. Hopefully that means they trust us to help them. I’m just sorry it took so long to get to this point.” \n\nMills’ ultimate goal is to zero out that backlog, though it’s a time-consuming and expensive process. It takes six months to process each kit, she says, adding that she’s got a couple she’d really like to expedite through the lab in order to get a particular offender off the streets. Expediting, she explains, costs extra. Her eyes gleam with a particular resolve, and she blazes out of the DPD media relations office on yet another mission: to send an email requesting those funds. You get the feeling that she’ll get them.  \n\n10 Brilliant Dallas Women:  \nDr. Rose Brock, Educator and Literary Advocate \nAnne Marie Weiss, International Community Builder \nKaleta Doolin Promotes Equality with Philanthropy and Art

0027_f7230353-a117-4537-b462-4302cc4323fc	"(CNN) -  \nA solo Japanese climber is expected to start the arduous trek to Camp II on Mount Everest, which at 21,000 feet (6,400 meters) will present a massive challenge to a man whose fingers were amputated to the first joint during a previous attempt to scale the world's highest mountain. \n \nNobukazu Kuriki will be the first and only climber attempting to summit Everest this season, nearly five months after dozens died in an avalanche, the mountain's deadliest accident to date. \n\nWhile the fall climbing season is a tough enough time to attempt to scale the world's highest mountain, the 33-year old is climbing alone and without oxygen. \n\nMajor handicap \n\nKuriki's hands were seriously damaged by frostbite during his 2012 attempt on Everest's West Ridge. He can use his right thumb for grip but isn't able to fully use an ice ax -- a critical part of a mountaineer's safety equipment. \n\n""I was told by a doctor that my performance will drop by more than 20%,"" Kuriki told CNN earlier this month. \n\n""I feel that it takes more time to do detailed work such as getting change from a vending machine. I lost my fingers but at the same time I learned a lot about life and many people supported me."" \n\nKuriki has been acclimatizing at Base Camp since September 7 -- a mere 17,700 feet (5,400 meters) up the mountain. \n\nHe was expected to set off for Camp II at 5 a.m. local time on Wednesday, reaching his destination before nightfall, according to Sachiko Kobayashi, Kuriki's secretary, based in Tokyo. \n\nBut the weather has been poor, with snowfall reported since Saturday -- though the conditions are expected to improve on Thursday, she said. However, Kuriki has not been in touch since 11 p.m. local time on Tuesday, she added. \n\nFifth attempt \n\nKuriki is no stranger to Everest's extreme conditions, from both the Chinese and Nepalese sides of the mountain. \n\nHis September solo quest will be the Hokkaido climber's fifth attempt to summit the mountain. \n\nIn 2009, Chinese officials ordered him off the mountain before he could complete his climbing schedule. \n\nBad weather and a fatal accident with his crew ended a 2010 attempt from the Nepalese side of the mountain. \n\nOn a subsequent try in 2011, his tent poles, supplies and cooking gas were dug up by Himalayan crows at his final camp, and in 2012, extreme cold and high winds ended his quest and left him with serious frostbite. \n\nOdds stacked against success \n\nAlthough he's successfully summited a number of 8,000-meter peaks in Nepal, including Cho Oyu, Manaslu, Dhaulagiri, and Mount Broad Peak, the odds of him successfully conquering Everest at 8,850 meters (29,035 feet), aren't great. \n\nMore than 10,000 climbers have tackled it since mountaineers began their assault on the massif in 1922, but it wasn't until 1953 that Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay conquered the mountain. \n\nSince then, more and more climbers have challenged Everest. One in 10 people who attempt it die. \n\nThe risks don't lessen when climbers head for home either. Avalanches, falls, high winds, extreme cold, fatigue and altitude sickness are as much of an issue on the descent. \n\nAdded risk \n\nMost climbers use oxygen to combat the effects of the notorious death zone -- above 8,000 meters -- where the oxygen level in the air is so low, it can't sustain human life. \n\nKuriki, who likes the challenge of winter climbing, will climb without oxygen, increasing his risks significantly. Without supplementary oxygen, climbers battle fatigue and confusion which can lead to accidents. \n\nKuriki has also decided to climb without the support of fellow climbers. He'll climb alone above Everest Base Camp while a cameraman and a Sherpa will climb separately to Camp 2 to record his climb."

0029_da9aacf0-00be-4818-9e62-d2dc448e5919	"(CNN) -  \nPope Francis will speak directly to Americans for the first time Wednesday as thousands of people gather in the shadow of the Washington Monument for a glimpse of the man whose humility and love for the poor has electrified the global Catholic Church. \n \nPresident Barack Obama will deploy the full pageantry of the White House to officially welcome Francis, who at the age of 78 is making his debut visit to a nation pulsing with the market capitalism and rampant consumerism he often decries. \n\nAfter speeches from the president and the pope, the two men will hold private talks, with only a translator present, in the Oval Office. Officials will not disclose what they will discuss, but issues such as the U.S. opening to Cuba that Francis helped broker, immigration, economic inequality and climate change could come up. \n\nThen, as an intense security operation swings into action, Francis will climb aboard his Popemobile and slowly navigate a route through the ceremonial plaza south of the White House known as the Ellipse and onto the National Mall. \n\nHuge crowds are expected to greet Francis, whose frequent shows of charity to the needy and Spartan Jesuit lifestyle have helped reinvigorate the image of the church after an era of abuse scandals thinned congregations. \n\nThe pope's speech will be closely watched for how far he strays onto perilous political ground on issues such as the treatment of undocumented migrants, abortion, global warming and the plight of those left destitute by capitalism's excesses. \n\nAmerican Catholics also are waiting to see whether the Spanish-speaking Pope goes off script -- as he sometimes does to speak candidly -- or whether his lack of fluency in English will mean he is less spontaneous than usual. \n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats, feuding in the early exchanges of the 2016 presidential race, will find plenty to chew over in his remarks. \n\nBut as he flew to the United States from Cuba on Tuesday, Francis told reporters he was not a politician and rejected the idea that he was a socialist, or a ""lefty"" following complaints by some conservatives he has embraced too many progressive causes. \n\nOn his plane on the way to Washington , the pope admitted he ""may have given the impression of being a little more to the left, but it would not be a correct interpretation."" \n\n""My doctrine ... this is the social doctrine of the Church. Nothing more, nothing less,"" he said. \n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest, meanwhile, said that Obama had no intention of using his talks with Francis to advance a political agenda, but did argue that the two leaders share common political and economic values. \n\n""This is a president who has been animated even before he started running for public office by the idea that we need to fight for social and economic justice both in this country and around the world,"" Earnest told CNN. ""This has been a hallmark of Pope Francis even before he arrived in the Vatican."" \n\nFrancis will later preside over the canonization of 18th-century Spanish priest Junipero Serra at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. \n\nOn Thursday, in the most political moment of his trip, the pope will address a joint meeting of Congress. Later in the week, he heads to New York where he will address the United Nations before ending his six-day stay in the United States in Philadelphia on Sunday."
0030_36b9a54c-8e3d-43bd-a175-d8a30093a625	"There's the old saying that goes, ""You can't know where you're going if you don't know where you've been."" I think Jesus said that. There's also a slightly less older saying that goes, ""Well, we know where we're goin', but we don't know where we've been."" That was David Byrne of the Talking Heads. I'm not mentally equipped to tell you which proverb is correct, but there's something important to be reflected upon in each. If you are truly clueless about the past, get ready for some blunders upon your path. (U.S. foreign policy shout out!) However, if you spend too much time wondering about the past you may remove yourself too much from the present and miss out on now. Is there some sort of middle path? A way to honor and acknowledge the past, yet be committed and bound to the future? Let's hope so. \n \nThe North Coast Journal is celebrating 25 years in existence, and as someone who has been writing for them 25 years less than that, I find that previous fact rather interesting. No one would have guessed that 25 years later this alt-weekly would be publishing not only a print edition, but a digital online companion as well. The music industry was more or less the same 25 years ago as well. When Byrne released his first solo album after leaving the Heads a little more than 25 years ago, even he probably couldn't imagine the future of the music industry shifting away from one that was almost exclusively based on physical units. \n \nAs musicians nowadays are cruelly aware, putting out a (good) album won't cut it as it did in the past. With CD sales in freefall, musicians need to not only get their albums up online, but also need to spend inordinate amounts of time on Facebook, Twitter, ReverbNation, Flickr, Grindr, Instagram and other horribly named social media platforms just to make enough to buy new guitar strings. Want to write a new song? Well your time is probably better spent hashtaggin' some cat video on Facebook to increase ""engagement"" with your fans, or crafting a retro looking music video to put on YouTube. The public wants more from bands today and for way less. Is that good or bad? Maybe it's neither, and just the way it is. We can't get too hung up on how things used to be, but just hope we're in the mix when things start becoming what they will be. With that in mind, and barely understood, it's no surprise that many bands these days are incorporating echoes of their heroes and sonic influences, or just covering them outright. Know where you've been? No idea where you're going? Me too. \n Thursday  \nIn an ode to the film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (released 44 years ago), Primus (formed 31 years ago) is touring to support its musical interpretation of said musical soundtrack. I've never thought about it before now, but if I had to imagine what Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka's inner monologue sounded like in 2015, it would probably sound a lot like Primus. Les Claypool probably would have made a damn good Wonka as well in the more recent release of the film (sorry, Johnny Depp). Anyway, catch Primus and the Chocolate Factory at the Eureka Muni tonight at 8 p.m. for $37.50. \n \nIf that's a little too rich for your taste, and going back one decade too far, head over to the Jam (what we have always called what used to be called the Jambalaya) for '80s Night with DJ Red . In terms of '80s dollars, adjusted for inflation, it's still free and starts at 9:30 p.m. \n Friday  \nSo-Cal retro rockers the Growlers will be performing for mostly HSU students tonight at the Van Duzer Theater on campus. With a kind of low-fi-psychedelic-'60s-surf-garage-rock sound, the Growlers are true to their So-Cal roots, sounding like a sunny L.A. band with choreographed, hip dance moves made for Top of the Pops , but with a bleaker lyrical content a la Laurel Canyon in the '70s post-cocaine-takeover. Their music video for ""Chinese Fountain"" — lamenting where technology has taken us — is all '70s mustaches and sideburns located somewhere around Grauman's Chinese Theater. The show's already sold out but maybe you'll find a way in around 10 p.m. Throw a quarter in the fountain kids, and make a wish. \n \nAt 9:30 p.m. you can catch the Sean Hayes Trio at Humboldt Brews. A 23 year native of San Francisco (I think), Mr. Hayes has a voice that sounds similar to Brett Dennen at points. To be fair, as Dennen is younger, it should be noted that Dennen's voice sounds a bit like Sean Hayes. $20 at the door for this show. \n \nHumboldt's premier Talking Heads tribute band, Naive Melodies , is at the Jam(balaya) at 10 p.m. My own kids were dancing it out pretty hard to ""Once in a Lifetime"" the other night, which would have made David Byrne proud. Bring your own lamp and dance the night away. Not sure what the price is, but it'll be worth it. \n Saturday  \nSpeaking of looking to the past for musical inspiration, Wake the Dead doesn't just go back to the Grateful Dead's catalogue for its sound, it goes all the way back to Celtic music. Always wanted to hear ""Brokedown Palace"" as if it were sung in a Cork County pub? This is your band. An 8 p.m. showtime at the Arcata Playhouse and $15 will get you in the door. \n \nHumboldt Brews has Soul Night tonight and for just $5 you can sweat and shake your booty at 9 p.m. \n \nThe Jam hosts hip-hop with Little Kidd Lost joined by recent album-releasers Object Heavy at 10 p.m. Price TBA. \n Sunday  \nThe Arcata Playhouse sees the return of Front Country which has one-sixth of its roots here in Humboldt County. A talented ensemble winning many awards for its ... well, talentedness. Catch 'em for $15 at 8 p.m. \n Monday  \nFor a sound hearkening back to gay Paris, when accordions were king and baguette makers didn't take the summers off, look no further than Musette Explosion . If you don't really know what that charming, lilting sound of French accordion music sounds like, but you want your friends to think you do, put Musette Explosion next to your Amelie soundtrack. They'll be at the Playhouse at 8 p.m. and $15 will put you in a great mood. \n \nFull show listings in the Journal 's Music and More grid, the Eight Days a Week calendar and online.

Forty-two days have passed since the second negative test on 22 July 2015 of the last laboratory-confirmed case. Liberia now enters a 90-day period of heightened surveillance. \n\nLiberia's ability to effectively respond to the outbreak of Ebola virus disease is due to intensified vigilance and rapid response by the government and multiple partners. Transmission had been declared over previously on 9 May 2015, but the disease re-emerged on 29 June and 6 additional cases were identified. \n\nOn 29 June 2015, midway through the first 90-day period, a routine post-mortem swab taken from a 17-year old male, who died on 28 June, tested positive for Ebola virus disease. Upon confirmation of this positive case, a specialized team was immediately dispatched and undertook a detailed investigation. \n\nUnder the leadership of the Liberia Government authorities, an effective response was rapidly initiated to contain the new outbreak. Members of the community were engaged and effectively contributed to contact tracing and social mobilization. International partners supported the government in areas such as technical assistance, provision of personnel,…
0032_3b69b8c0-32ae-4a7b-9403-4346b8c9ad75	"Versatility is a good thing at a lot of positions, especially when it can be used to find a matchup advantage or fill a key need. The offensive line really isn't one of them. At least, not game after game after game. Penn State likes the fact that it has a few players that can play center, guard, or tackle at any point in any given game. It trains its linemen to be able to do that, and it helps when injuries occur. But any program, the Lions included, would prefer to keep a set five at the same positions for a full game. Head coach James Franklin and his program, due to injuries and poor play, haven't been able to do that much over their first 15 games in State College. They made a adjustment for skill reasons at the start of Saturday's game versus Buffalo by moving Andrew Nelson from right to left tackle, Brendan Mahon from left guard to right tackle, and then inserted Derek Dowrey, who played as a reserve a week earlier against Temple, as the starting left guard. Then, when Nelson got hurt at halftime, the program brought Week 1 starter Paris Palmer back in to play left tackle, and kept everything else the same. It's not clear if Nelson will play this week, and it was interesting that the program didn't move starting center Angelo Mangiro, who played tackle in 2014, out to that spot. Franklin said Tuesday that part of the reason was because of Mangiro's calming presence in the middle, but if reserve interior lineman Wendy Laurent is more of a full-go this week, the Lions' senior center could seemingly be moved elsewhere. More: Penn State injury update, a look at the punting issues, and more : James Franklin news conference takeaway ""We didn't have Wendy completely available the last couple of weeks,"" Franklin said. ""That factored into it. I think the other thing is you could make the argument that your tackles are very important to what you're doing, but your center is the QB of the offensive line, and Angelo has a calming effect to the whole group. ""He's able to lead and be a real vocal presence. I think that's the biggest thing, have the one senior be at center."" Mahon has played tackle before, too, which was another reason the program felt comfortable making that switch. He's listed at right tackle again for Saturday's game with Rutgers, and Dowrey is listed at left guard with Nelson slotted at left tackle. If the Hershey High native doesn't play, though, shuffling will again have to take place. For his part, Mangiro embraces his role as the leader and calming presence along the Lions' line, no matter where he lines up. Flounders: Penn State's Jason Cabinda's 'a man' in the middle, Troy Reeder coming on strong, per James Franklin ""I think that's part of my role on the team, being that senior that's kind of been through some things,"" he said Tuesday. ""That's just my role, to keep guys positive and tell them to move on to the next play and things like that."" Penn State's offensive line, which allowed quarterback Christian Hackenberg to be hit just twice on 67 snaps against Buffalo per Franklin, won't have to face talented Rutgers' tackle Darius Hamilton this week, as he's already been ruled out. The Scarlet Knights have five sacks in two game, and like last year, are expected to dial up plenty of pressure to get after the Lions' offense. It means the offensive line, no matter what combination it starts and subsequently uses throughout the game, must be ready. A healthy Nelson and a ready to play Laurent will help. Penn State's mission vs. Rutgers: Don't give dangerous Janarion Grant any room to roam Being able to use a consistent five would be of great benefit, too."

Unbeknownst to Plies (he says), the little girl featured in the video turned out to be Young Thug’s daughter. \n \nThug in turn made a post of his own urging fans to tell the Florida-based rapper to take the video down but not before also threatening Plies and insinuating that if he didn’t take the video down by the end of the day there would be a heavy price to pay. \n \nPlies then responded to Thug’s threat with another post of his own stating, “Ion Disrespect Nobody Children.” before reiterating that he merely posted the clip to emphasize exactly how tired he was. Later on in the post he responds directly to Thug’s threat to him by saying, “If you had a problem with it, f–k n—a, you ask me to take it down. You don’t threaten me to do nothing, p—y n—a.” \n \nIt appears Plies may be awaiting an apology or a more civilized request from Thug regarding the matter because the post in question currently remains on Plies’ account . \n \nCheck out a screenshot of the original post below.
0034_f69ff4d5-ebaf-4c85-a3c1-4f185887e57c	Pressing questions are always asked about my prime-time viewing: \nMy wife: “What network is ‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’ on?” I didn’t answer. Instead, I asked: “What\nbroadcast network did ‘The Mindy Project” air on?” She said: “NBC!”   \n\nIt’s a confusing media world for sure. \n\n“Mindy” was on Fox; now\nat Hulu; “Nine-Nine” is going into its third season on Fox, one of the few shows to grow its audience -- 4.87 million in its second season from 4.80 million viewers. So, who cares what\nnetwork it’s on? Branding, schmanding! \n\nOn the flip side, there are easy network brand associations: For many in my household, it can be easy to identify the content on networks like Food\nand Hallmark, but tough to identify specific shows. \n\nOver the weekend, I stumbled upon the team-time trial race at the World Road Cycling Championships in Richmond, Virginia -- not on NBCSN, the\nsports network-- but on CNBC, NBC’s business news network. I guess this make sense: This time of year I’m “cycling” in and out of stock investments in my\nportfolio. \n\nSeeing content in places you don’t expect? Not a trend. \n\nStill, NBC regularly uses many of its dozen or so cable networks when it has way too many Olympic events to cover.\nTurner airs plenty of NCAA Men’s basketball tournament games on its networks. Viacom recently aired the MTV “Video Music Awards” this year on many more of its cable networks. \n\nMuch of this makes economic sense, with networks looking to monetize increasingly expensive programming assets. \n\nSo with the start of the new season, does it matter that the average TV\nviewer might not associate new shows with their networks, like “Supergirl” and “The Muppets”? (“Supergirl” will be on CBS; “The Muppets,” ABC”). \n\nYes, you might say broadcasters can have a strong identify: CBS has lots of crime procedurals; ABC has racy and sharp dramas. \n\nYet in the future, established TV network brands might want\nto be a lot of more than they are.
0035_c2ceda4a-eddb-4fbd-90f4-ec747c8f7b2f	The fireplace has been running a tad inefficiently, oh, ok, then it has started to smoke a bit recently. Getting a sweep in is always a bit problematic due to the shape of the roof and the fact that some of the locals are fraidy-cats when it comes to heights...\n\n\n\nDue to the H-cap on top, they really need to get up top and take this off. casting around for alternative ideas, I stumbled across this: the Gardus Inc RCH205 Sooteater Rotary Chimney Cleaning System.  Normally the cost of shipping large items from the is a major reason for not ordering something like this but I couldn't find anything even close anywhere closer and the shipped price wasn't much more that the price of conventional hand brushes bought locally. Because the flue is so long, I thought it was also a good idea to invest in a set of extension poles.\n\nDelivery down under only took five days, something of a record I think, especially since that involved rural delivery as well. Even though they arrived two weeks ago, I've had to wait for a nice day off to try them out.\n\n\n\nLess the drill this is what you get: six poles = two more in the extension set, the rorating head, comprehensive instructions in English and French; and a sheet of clear plastic to cover the mouth of the fireplace to keep the dislodged soot in.\n\n\n\nThere's also an adaptor that connects the poles to any common hand drill; and a hand tool for depressing the detent on each pole to release it from its mate and allow the assembled poles to be broken down. There are no Allen key-ed parts so the Allen key on the not-pointy end is a bonus.\nAssembly and preparation was easy, taking only a few minutes: the lines on the rotating head had to be trimmed to fit the diameter of the flue - a handy cutting guide is provided...\n\n....and the poles had to be assembled. This is a simple clip system but I had to make two sets as I didn't have room in front of the fire place to lay the whole length out.\n\nI didn't use the plastic sheet but placed drop cloths over the couches just in case things got messy. As it happened I needed have bothered. The whole process was pretty painless. I had the garage vac running in the fire box - while it didn't pick up a lot of the debris as it fell, it was great and sucking up the dust and keeping that bfrom floeing into the lounge.\n .   \n\nUse was easy - don't know why I was worried about this.\n\n\n\nHooked the drill up to the first length, guided the cleaning head into the chimney and away we went. After working the heading up and down a couple of times, I added in the next length of four poles and up we went, all the way to the top. As expected the greater amount oif debris came from above the roof line we I suspect the colder air and metal has been encouraging the smoke to scale against the insides of the flue - certainly the second half resulted a lot more debris coming down.\n\nThe shaft spun easily in my hands and runs up and down the flue with no problems or stoppages. Once the the flow of sooty debris ceased, I reversed the process and brought the shaft out by sections. It had cleaned out a lot of soot and scale, enough to fill a vacuum bag, maybe 2-3 kilograms. The only question is whether there are any obstructions in the H itself - hope not as otherwise we will be needing to get someone in as this is not a roof to be casually scaled - the test of that will be tonight. If the H is part of the problem, it'll be replaced with a conventional straight through cap so the shaft can push all the way out the top. The set all broken down -  took less than five minutes - and ready to go away. Clean up inside only took another five minutes or so.\n\nI don't know why a tool like this is not readily available here as it is a quick and simple way of performing a dirty task that also keeps homes safe by reducing the risk of chimney fire; and contributes to home health by enabling fires to burn warmer and more efficiently.

0037_97b8156a-4903-441c-a50d-1a2f75ec2831	It seems like only yesterday Made in Chelsea swapped the plush comforts of SW3 for the fast-paced streets of LA, yet we’ve finally had to wave goodbye to our favourite reality TV show as we watched the finale of Made in Chelsea: LA. \n  \nAs if it's the series finale already, why you gotta leave so soon #MiCLA !? \n \n— Simone (@SimoneLMartin) September 14, 2015 \n \nIt’s been a turbulent summer for the gang Stateside – Jamie’s managed to stir up romantic conflict (unsurprisingly), JP stamped all over Binky’s heart after leading her on for months, Louise shocked us all with the possibility of shacking up with Alik in New York and Mark-Francis is, well, as fabulous as ever. \n \nHere are eight very important things that happened in the final of Made in Chelsea: LA. \n \n1. Jamie now wants to be in a relationship. \n \nWhile at a sophisticated brunch with Lucy and Alex, Jamie reveals that he’s actually yearning for a relationship, now ready to commit, and wants to confess his love to Jess. \n \n“I think that’s really dumb,” Lucy said. \n \n“You both played so many games it’s so tiring.” \n  \nI'm pretty sure that Jamie is incapable of being in a relationship #MiCLA \n   Promoted stories   \n— Manda (@amandabeech) September 14, 2015 \n \nNevertheless the serial-dater hatched an elaborate plan to get Jess all by herself to declare his undying feelings to her, but somehow we don’t think Jamie will get the fairytale ending he’s hoping for. \n \n2. Ollie’s back! \n \nAfter enduring a brutal rejection from JP in last week’s episode, Binky jetted straight back to SW3 to seek comfort from a familiar face… Ollie Locke. \n  \nAhhh Ollie you've been missed ❤️ #MiCLA \n \n— Raj (@Rajjohal7) September 14, 2015 \n \nWhile confiding to an old friend, Binky revealed some rather shocking news – just two days before she received the boot from JP in LA, the two had had sex. \n \nBefore Ollie could shower Binks with consoling words, he just had to ask the question we were all wondering… \n  \nStandard question 'Was he good?' #MiCLA \n \n— Charlotte Cope (@cope_charlotte) September 14, 2015 \n \n3. Lucy and James are the cutest. \n \nThey’ve been our favourite from the moment they laid eyes on each other and, having proved there is at least one happy couple in Chelsea, we couldn’t love Lucy and James more. \n  \nJames and Lucy are easily my favourite couple ever. #MadeInChelsea  #MiCLA \n \n— Paula (@PaulaBrooksx) September 14, 2015 \n  \nLucy and James are my favourite couple #MiCLA \n \n— • (@Ollyowe) September 14, 2015 \n  \nOn a mission to find the James to my Lucy..  #MiCLA \n \n— Laura Baker (@lbakes) September 14, 2015 \n \n4. Jamie and Naz finally patched things up. \n \nAfter taking her on some pretty amazing dates and only to then, erm, get with Jess behind her back, Jamie finally took the time to explain his behaviour to Naz. \n \nSomewhere amidst admitting he had acted selfishly and that he had still have feelings for Jess, Jamie did what we would never have expected in a million years and apologised. \n  \nWas that Jamie… being mature? And… admitting that he was wrong? Christ. #MiCLA \n \n— Rebecca Taylor (@rjtaylor90) September 14, 2015 \n \nHas Jamie grown up once and for all?! \n \n5. Who knew Alex would be the voice of reason? \n \nWhen Alik let slip JP and Binky had been secretly hooking up, there was one person who wasn’t too happy to hear the news… Alex. \n  \nIf ALEX of all people thinks you're out of order JP, then you really are out of order! #MICLA \n \n— Carla Scudder (@CarlaScudder) September 14, 2015 \n \nAlex, the man who had himself cheated on Binky numerous times, bizarrely jumped to his ex’s defence, berating JP for his behaviour, and everyone seemed to love his new-found outlook on life. \n  \nIt's wrong that I actually like Alex now. #MiCLA \n \n— Lianne (@Lianne2024) September 14, 2015 \n  \nOhhhh Alex got a smidge of respect from me there  #MiCLA \n \n— Lindsay H Coombes (@Linlou1982) September 14, 2015 \n  \nCan I just say Alex has been amazing this series! Love him again. Calling JP out makes him doubly amazing #MiCLA \n \n— Seyi (@ruiningf0otball) September 14, 2015 \n \n6. We all need a friend like Louise in our lives. \n \nIf there’s one person who hasn’t taken too well to this Binky/JP fiasco (besides the couple themselves) it’s little Louise, and she sure didn’t hold back in the season’s finale. \n  \nYou may not like the way Louis's spoke to JP but she only said the truth! JP has been an arse #MiCLA \n \n— Roisin (@RoRoSuperRo) September 14, 2015 \n \n“You seem to be having a lot of fun,” Louise said to JP, while the gang were at a Malibu beach party. \n \n“I’ve heard you’ve been messaging a lot of girls and keeping your options open.” \n \nUh oh. \n \nJP, being the honest soul that he is, denied ever have messaging a single female while he was with Binky but Louise, being as relentless as she is, soon drove him into a corner… \n  \nLouise knows how to interrogate! I love it sticking up for her bestie! #MiCLA \n \n— Daria Morgendorffer (@ItsSho) September 14, 2015 \n \nThe rumours were found to be true as JP finally admitted he had been chatting to other ladies while with Binks – but swore he stopped once the two became “serious”. \n \n“I think the whole thing is so destructive, just leave her alone. And I never want to fucking speak to you about it again,” Louise shot back, storming off in true Made in Chelsea style. \n  \nI seriously need a friend like Louise in my life, her loyalty to Binky is amazing #MiCLA \n \n— charlotte (@chxrlotteprice) September 14, 2015 \n  \nI love Louise! Totally has her girls back ✋ #MiCLA \n \n— sophie spencer (@SophieSpencerx) September 14, 2015 \n  \nI love @LouiseAThompson so much ❤️❤️❤ you go girl #MiCLA \n \n— Erin (@eringarvie1) September 14, 2015 \n \n7. It’s about time Jamie got his heart broken – but our hearts are breaking too. \n \nThe whole episode was gearing up to the moment Jamie confessed all to an unsuspecting Jess, and while us at home knew Jess didn’t reciprocate his feelings of love, Jamie was none the wiser. \n \n“I want you, and know I could give you the world,” he told Jess, only to be interrupted mid-sentence. \n \n“Stop! I’m not ready, I don’t want to lose you as a friend, I don’t want to be in a relationship with you. I love you, but I’m not in love with you,” Jess said, teary-eyed. \n  \nJamie and Jess would have been such a cute couple #MiCLA \n \n— Amyealham (@amyealham_) September 14, 2015 \n \nWhile we have to admit, we did feel a slight sense of satisfaction seeing Jamie being played at his own game, we couldn’t help but feel for the dude who genuinely looked like his whole world had just fallen apart in front of his eyes. \n  \nCompletely broken-hearted after watching that Jess and Jamie chat  #MiCLA \n \n— Bella.  (@isabellaholly) September 14, 2015 \n  \nJess and Jamie break my heart in every way possible #MiCLA \n \n— georgia • (@GeorgiaSBrown) September 14, 2015 \n  \nI wish Jess would just give it a go with Jamie already, clearly perfect for each other! :( #MiCLA \n \n— Australopithecus (@HopeMurrayyy) September 14, 2015 \n \n8. There’s a hell lot more in store where that came from. \n \nAs the finale wrapped up we were treated to a sneak preview of what’s around the corner in the new season soon to hit our screens. \n  \nOMG IVE MISSED SPENCER MADE IN CHELSEA SEASON 10 PLEASE COME QUICK \n \n— NYASHA (@zagarinocity) September 14, 2015 \n \nThe gang is back in Chelsea and seemingly welcomes the return of Spenny, Ollie and Rosie (though no one is too enthused about that) as well as shock news of infidelity in Tiff and Sam’s relationship – and this time, it isn’t on Sam’s part… \n  \nTIFF CHEATS ON SAM WHAT #MadeInChelsea \n \n— Sophie Scott-James (@SophieScottJame) September 14, 2015 \n   \n Share article  \n    \n  \n 
0038_8ff9a4d1-a7b0-4e02-a55f-5df0f6031893	"NEW YORK \n\n""As we talk to new parents worldwide, it's clear that children's happiness and feelings of being loved are of primary importance,"" said Jean McKenzie \n\n""EQ, or emotional intelligence, is the ability to understand emotions in oneself and others, and to use that understanding to achieve positive goals,"" said Sara Harkness \n\nThe Moms' Hopes & Wishes Study, conducted by Illuminas Global on behalf of Fisher-Price, measured parental attitudes and approaches to Early Childhood Development with 3,500 new and soon-to-be moms in seven countries. Though findings indicated more similarities in beliefs than differences, the study highlights cultural nuances, or 'parental ethnotheories,' apparent in specific countries. For example, one question asked, ""What qualities are important for your child to achieve?"" In response, Chinese moms in the survey valued grit/tenacity, Brazilian moms said environmental awareness, and Russian moms chose athleticism. Another question asked moms what level of agreement they had with the notion that development begins at birth. This resulted in a wide range of responses, with the highest level of agreement from Russia \n\n""It's been proven that development begins at birth, and parents can greatly impact their child's future success in the early years just by loving and engaging with their child every day,"" said Shakira. ""Through the work I've done with my Barefoot Foundation, I've seen parents make a big difference in their child's healthy development through the daily practice of things like reading to them, talking, singing or even simply playing. We as parents are their first teachers and it's never too early to start."" \n\nShakira also previewed her parenting app, Grow, for post natal moms. The app features 2,000 tips including play ideas, mini articles and activities customized to a child's age to foster early childhood development from birth and through age five in a fun and easy way. The app also features a timeline to track developmental milestones with the ability to share out with friends and family. The app will be available later this fall.\n\nIntrigued to see what the 3.2 million Fisher-Price Facebook followers have to say about the survey findings, the Company is engaging parents in a four-week global conversation starting this week. Each week, questions from the survey will be fielded to the community for responses. Additionally, a microsite featuring a summary of the global study, as well as country-specific data and articles, is available by visiting www.fisher-price.com/HappyFactor. \n\n""We want to engage moms around the world on their views of early childhood development, and this study is just one of the ways we hope to spark conversation with parents and the organizations and communities that support them,"" said McKenzie. ""It's part of living our promise to help enrich the lives of families with young children.""\n\nThis event is part of the Company's ongoing Best Possible Start campaign aimed at elevating the importance of early childhood development to the new generation of parents.\n\nAbout the Survey and Key Findings\n\nThe Moms' Hopes & Wishes Study was conducted during a four-week period between February and March of 2015, across various socio-economic groups, with more than 3,500 moms between the ages of 21-40 years old. Fifty percent of the participants were first-time, pre-natal moms; the rest were first-time moms of a single child, 0-18 months old. Local surveys were conducted online or in-person across seven countries, including China \n\nOptimistic About Baby's Bright Future \n\nWhen asked about the opportunities their child will have to fulfill their potential compared to the opportunities they had, moms in five out of seven countries felt their children will have it better, with over 80% percent agreement in China \n\nFirst & Best Teacher?\n\nAll countries have high agreement that ""A parent's relationship with baby is the foundation of healthy development."" However, it was China \n\nLet Children Be Children\n\nRoughly half of moms surveyed felt it's important to push children to reach their full potential, and for their children to reach milestones quickly and ahead of others. This was especially evident in Brazil \n\nPower of Play\n\nThe study revealed that moms are definitely engaged in play with their child. In fact, one of the top-ranked parenting attitudes was ""Play is the way children learn naturally.""\n\nAbout Fisher-Price\n\nIn 1931, Herman Fisher \n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150924/270619 \n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-new-iq-fisher-price-international-study-reveals-todays-moms-highly-focused-on-developing-their-childs-character-as-much-as-intelligence-300148839.html\n\nSOURCE Fisher-Price"

0042_de551d14-d99e-43ac-977d-3ea193653681	LONDON , Sept. 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Summary \n\nAfter a promising number of mobile wallet initiatives in 2011, with Google Wallet a driving force, market expectations have fallen somewhat flat. Despite the emergence of alternative payment solutions, though, mobile wallet solutions appear to be back on the radar. The entire mobile industry (smartphone manufacturers, telecommunication companies, and chip makers) coupled with the finance ecosystem (banks, financial Institutions, payment processors, and platform providers) have invested heavily in the mobile payment opportunity. According to Frost & Sullivan, the value of mobile payment transactions will reach  billion in 2020, with a % compound annual growth rate (CAGR) evident from 2014 to 2020. Moreover, the number of active users will increase rapidly to reach million in 2023. By 2020, Asia-Pacific will represent % of transaction value, while the European region will hold a % share. \n\nThe mobile wallet will evolve from a simple payment solution to an application that will support various services such as loyalty and couponing. Mobile wallet adoption is directly linked to consumer perception  consumers must be convinced that it provides a real value add with discounts and coupons. The market is still fragmented, featuring a number of technologies, electronic devices, and security features. Nevertheless, consolidation is evident, with dedicated partnerships or acquisitions to take place in order to facilitate communication with a single product or brand, or message promotion. Innovation continues apace; wearable devices will undoubtedly have an impact on payment trends by changing usage models and consumers habits. Mobile wallets will probably be able to interact with or be embedded in wearables. \n\nBackground \n\nThis analysis will answer the following questions for a global audience: \n\n- What is the current mobile wallet landscape, and what are the latest trends? \n- How much mobile wallet revenue can be expected through 2020? \n- What is the anticipated adoption rate? How is the mobile wallet evolving by region? \n\nDigital transformation has already happened in many banks and financial institutions. Services have been integrated into Web platforms, and a cloud-based approach appears to be the way to optimize costs and provide an exciting customer experience. Mobile devices are at the centre of this new strategy. Mobile payments and banking are now standard services at all banks. \n\nThe increasing number of new payment solutions, security mechanisms, and mobile technologies is revolutionizing the payment ecosystem; however, new entrants, historical participants, and innovative challengers have to fight to promote their solutions or initiatives. A flood of product announcements has left consumers bewildered and reluctant to adopt mobile payments. As a result, mobile wallet adoption has fallen short of expectations. Even in this challenging context, the payment industry is promoting mobile wallets as being frictionless, convenient, and speedy. \n\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3307339/ \n\nAbout Reportbuyer \nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers \nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com  \n\nFor more information: \nSarah Smith  \nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com \nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com  \nTel: +44 208 816 85 48 \nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com \n \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mobile-walletsamazon-apple-and-google-seek-the-winning-strategy-300152153.html \n \nSOURCE  ReportBuyer \n\n\n\nCopyright 2014 PR Newswire.

This comes after Russia dispatched aircraft and heavy weapons to Syria.\n\nDuring his 60 Minutes interview Putin declared that this was perfectly legal and done at the request of the Syrian government, in contrast to the actions of the American-lead coalition.\n\n""In my opinion, provision of military support to illegal structures runs counter to modern international law and the United Nations charter,"" he said\n\n""We've been providing assistance to legitimate government entities only.""\n\nEarlier in the day the United States Secretary of State, John Kerry, held talks with the Russian Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on the issue.\n\nLater, a separate senior State Department official described the talks as a ""very thorough exchange of views on the political and military implications of Russia's increased engagement.\n\n""We are at the beginning of trying to understand what the Russians intentions are in Syria, in Iran, and to try to see if there are mutually beneficial ways forward, we have a long way to go,"" she said.\n\nShe said the US was seeking not only to ""deconflict"" – that is to try to ensure that the two coalitions now fighting ISIL do not stumble into one another – but also to see if there was a political way forward.\n\nShe said Iraq had not been discussed in the meeting.\n\nShe also noted that Russia's increased engagement in the conflict carried with it responsibility.\n\n""Now, when a country becomes more deeply engaged, that does increase responsibility for the outcome and increase risk, so, those are obviously things that have to be considered on the Russian side.""\n\nIn fact, Russia's support of Assad since the beginning of the conflict in Syria in 2011 has arguably prolonged the war and exacerbated the bloodshed.\n\n""The destruction of Syria is a consequence of the policies of Assad,"" the Dutch foreign minister, Bert Koenders after a counter terrorism meeting attended by the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, on Sunday morning in New York.\n\n""You see everyday the bombing. Most of the refugees are fleeing Assad, and ISIS.""\n\nNonetheless, Mr Koenders was among the Western diplomats still wrestling with Assad's future roll.\n\n""All countries have an interest in ensuring there is not a complete destruction of Syria. That means in essence we must have a diplomatic solution … and I would go by what we have agreed in Geneva, that is a transition government is there to come, but there is no future for Assad.""\n\nBut asked if that meant Assad had to stand down before a new government could be formed, Mr Koenders said it was more important to focus on what was most successful for peace.\n\n""My view is that the positions are ambiguous,"" he said.\n\nThe first concrete evidence that partners in the war on ISIL might be softening on their stance on the removal of Assad came last week when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said following an EU leaders' meeting that talks on the Syrian conflict should involve Assad.\n\nLeaders and diplomats in New York this weekend were still grappling to find forms of words to explain this change.\n\nAustralian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop insisted that the acceptance that Assad might have some role in a political solution in Syria was not a ""softening"", but a recognition of the new reality.\n\n""Australia's position is that all options should be on the table. Nothing should be discarded at this point, no permutation of a political solution should be rejected, while we consider what is realistic and what is achievable.\n\n""That is realpolitik, that is being realistic. In 2011 there was a Geneva process that set out what the coalition partners believed was achievable at the time. It hasn't achieved it, so therefore we should reconsider the position.""\n\nAustralia's interest in Syria's future is manifold and complicated.\n\nNot only are Australian forces engaged with the fight against ISIL, but an estimated 120 of its citizens are fighting with militant groups in the region.\n\nAnd then there is the question of the investigation of the shooting down of MH17, which claimed the lives of 38 Australian citizens and residents, and of which Australia is taking a leading role.\n\nThere is some speculation that one of Mr Putin's goals in the ongoing power play is too secure assurance that the investigation will not lead to prosecutions.\n\nSo far most credible analysis pins the blame for the disaster on Russian-backed separatists operating in eastern Ukraine.\n\nMs Bishop has insisted Australia will not cease in efforts to pursue justice over the atrocity. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald."

Can you ever really get away from the terror and learn to trust yourself again? \n\nResa Goldberg's provocative and, at times, painful new memoir, Love Me Madly (published by Moonshine Cove Publishing, LLC. ( www.moonshinecovepublishing.com ) introduces her as a starry-eyed teenybopper whose innocence is crushed by a series of horrifying sexual and physical assaults that spanned two years during high school. The book chronicles her journey from that harrowing trauma to divorced mom navigating the shoals of Internet dating. Somehow, and despite considerable evidence to the contrary, she never abandons her abiding belief that not only does Mr. Right exist, but that he's right around the corner---hidden somewhere in that Rogues Gallery of boys and men. \n\nThe payoff at the end provides the author an understanding of the past--why she has made such bad choices, a way forward into a happier future and finally a mission to help girls and women who may have suffered similar experiences. \n\nAt Goldberg's official book launch ( www.resagoldberg.com ) she donated a portion of her book sales to and organized a raffle for Safe Alliance, an organization that assists victims of sexual assault, teen pregnancy and domestic violence. On September 3, Mike Collins, host of WFAE's ""Charlotte Talks"" program (Charlotte's NPR affiliate) interviewed her about her experiences, what she has learned and how she is continuing to forge her relationship with Safe Alliance and speak out against violence against women. ( http://wfae.org/post/abuse-and-recovery-love-me-madly-memoir ). She was joined on ""Charlotte Talks"" by Licensed Professional Counselor Dr. Christopher McCarthy, co-creator of the Turnaround Anxiety Program and Blog ( www.turnaroundanxiety.com ). \n\nThe story that inspired Love Me Madly: A Memoir has also been featured in The Charlotte Observer ( http://www.charlotteobserver.com/entertainment/books/reading-matters- ... 16263.html ), The Carolinas Weekly Newspapers ( http://thecharlotteweekly.com/arts_entertainment/2015/07/south-charlo ... es-memoir/ ) and Today's Charlotte Woman ( http://issuu.com/tcwmagazine/docs/tcw_aug_sept_2015/10?e=5554085/14448382 ). \n\nResa has more than 20 years experience as a reporter, writer and editor for radio, television, newspapers and magazines and a master's degree in broadcast journalism from the University of Georgia. Her work has been published in both local and national publications, including The Business Journals, Pro, Street & Smith's SportsBusiness Journal and NASCAR Illustrated. She has helped launch three magazines in Charlotte, where she currently lives. \n\nLove Me Madly: A Memoir is available at Amazon ( http://www.amazon.com/Love-Me-Madly-Resa-Goldberg/dp/193732771X/ref=s ... e+Me+Madly ) and Barnes & Noble ( http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/love-me-madly-a-memoir-resa-goldberg/ ... 1937327712 ) and Resa is also available for motivational speaking engagements at universities or civic groups.

0048_79f3b4cd-39d2-46c5-b3af-d998e4f4f17b	"Jessa Seewald has offered up the first signs that the Duggar family may be imploding after Josh Duggar ’s horrendous behaviors have come to light. Up until Jessa’s latest Twitter post on Tuesday, the family stood silently behind Josh after he made a confession that he has an infatuation with porn, along with being named a client of Ashley Madison by online hackers. \n \nSince Josh’s Ashley Madison reveal, his immediate Duggar family has been noticeably quiet, besides Josh’s brother-in-law, who wants his sister Anna to leave her cheating husband. Now Jessa has joined ranks online with her father-in-law, who published an open letter condemning Josh for calling himself a Christian, but acting otherwise, reports MSN News on September 2. \n \nMichael Seewald, who is Jessa’s father-in-law, used strong and harsh words when calling out Josh’s behavior on the Seewald family’s website. On Tuesday, the 22-year-old Jessa Duggar Seewald took to Twitter to write, “Go to seewalds.com and read the post on Ashley Madison scandal."" On Thursday morning there were ""too many requests"" and you couldn't get to the Seewald family site. \n \nPreviously Jessa hinted to her disdain for what her brother did when posting a passage from the Bible on Instagram, 1 John 1:6,  which reads, ""If we say we have fellowship with [God] while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth."" This appeared to be Jessa’s subtle way of letting the Duggar fans know that she does not condone what her brother did. \n \nHer subtle way is now replaced by introducing this spew from her father-in-law. People Magazine suggests that Jessa turned her back on her brother with this latest tweet. They too wonder if a ""family feud"" is brewing within the Duggar family. \n \nHer father-in-law was anything but subtle and while he is related to Jessa through marriage, some might find it a bit odd that he has jumped into the spotlight to condemn Josh’s behavior when he really has no connection to him. If it were Anna’s father, that would be different, but he is not. \n \nThe lengthy post read similar to a sermon and included, “It distresses me to say that Josh Duggar’s greatest sin is a byproduct of the sum total of his secretly sinful lifestyle. That is, that by his hypocrisy, he blasphemed the name of God. He claimed to be a Christian, but by his deeds he has suggested otherwise,"" Michael Seewald claims to write this post because he has ""an overwhelming desire to vindicate the name of God."" \n \nApparently Jessa agreed with him because she was directing readers his way. This can’t put Jessa in a favorable light with the Duggar family who are close-knit and stick together. This appears to be the first sign of the online wreckage Josh is leaving in his wake from all that sinning, which Michael Seewald so graciously points out."

0050_418ba2dd-bdbe-4d7c-b9ad-63b175ae794b	I bought a large chunk of ground beef at Mitchell's so I could make a big meatloaf for the dog. To the 700gm (close to two pounds) of beef I added 1/4 cup bred crumbs, salt, mixed pepper, fresh garlic chopped, a couple of sprigs of fresh thyme, a sprig of rosemary. In a bread pan I laid a stripe of tomato ketchup along the bottom, placed the loaf on top and spread dijon mustard liberally over the load. Then more ketchup on top.  Into the oven at 350F for 1.25 hours. Fresh carrot with frozen peas for the vegetable and mashed potato for the starch. A humble meal but it tasted good. The dog loved the meat loaf better than ground beef with salt. He's a fussy eater so this surprised me. Fern had a sandwich of meatloaf next day for lunch so I think that says enough about it.

(NASDAQ CM: SINO) (""Sino-Global"" or the ""Company""), a Virginia company engaged in shipping, chartering, logistics and related services, today announced the formation of SGS Logistics, the Company's U.S.-based freight forwarding and logistics services network (the ""Network""). The Network is a part of Sino-Global's new strategic plan to grow its business in the U.S. and is intended to extend the Company's integrated service platform into the freight forwarding business. It is intended that during the initial phase, the Network will have operations in the North East and the West Coast; both operations will be led by industry veterans, each with over 20 years of experience in the shipping and logistics industries. \n\nFreight forwarding and logistics services entail the transportation of cargoes from one destination to another, including the moving and processing of cargoes, management of necessary paperwork, duties, and compliance with related rules and regulations. Given the large scope of the international shipping business, along with its numerous requirements, the Company believes freight forwarding services presents a substantial business opportunity for Sino-Global. The Company believes that the Network and the resulting service platform would aid in the establishment of a U.S.-based door-to-door freight forwarding service platform for clients with containerized cargoes leaving the U.S. for China, or from China to the U.S. The Company believes these services will help ensure that cargoes get to their proper destination by an agreed upon date, and in good condition and they would include, among other things, custom clearance and trucking services.\n\nOverview of the SGS Logistics Network SGS Logistics will be the freight forwarding and logistics services network for Sino-Global, designed to capitalize on the rapidly growing containerized shipping market in the U.S. The Network, the Company believes, would provide customers with reliable, cost-effective, customized solutions while allowing participating Network members, such as small- and medium-size U.S.-based freight forwarding and logistics companies, to service the logistics needs of Sino-Global's customers - clearing their shipments through customs and transporting their cargoes from the unloading ports to their final destination. \n\nMr. Lei Cao, Chief Executive Officer of Sino-Global, said, ""Leveraging this logistics services network, Sino-Global believes it can develop a strong, US-based business and related cash flows while gradually redirecting our strategic focus away from China. We believe that there is a robust U.S. market and growing demand for customized logistics services, based on discussions we have had with various cargo owners, freight forwarding companies and trucking companies.

0056_4bbd75b9-a563-4a09-be24-2c4ddabaf832	DON’T get me wrong – I enjoyed this book very much indeed. It has an unobtrusively elegant prose style coupled to propulsive plot momentum; deft characterisation and intelligent commentary.\n\nSweet Caress\n\nWilliam Boyd\n\nBloomsbury, £18.99\n\nI suppose my misgiving is a vague sense that if I had set out to write a hoax William Boyd novel, it would have been very similar to Sweet Caress.\n\nLike James Todd in The New Confessions or Mountstuart in Any Human Heart, the protagonist is an artist (although in this case female, and a photographer) through whose eyes we witness the major events of the 20th century. Amory Clay’s relationships with men – her father, her lovers, her husband, a late flowering lust, her daughter’s inamorato – are conditioned by combat and the repression of what is done or left undone in war. As with Restless, there is an examination of how younger generations deal with the compromises of the old. There is still the same comedy that typified his first novel, A Good Man In Africa, though it’s more shrewd and less antic. It is especially sharp when dealing with stereotypically “British” attitudes (and there are laugh-out-loud moments, for example, the procurement of a fake moustache to practise kissing in a girls’ school).\n\nAs one would expect from the author of the fictitious biography, Nat Tate: An American Artist 1928-1960, the text is judiciously peppered with what the reader is encouraged to believe are Amory’s own photographs. It’s a typically Boydian wink that the epigraph, from which the title is taken, comes from one of the fictitious characters in the novel. \n\nAmory’s father, an intermittently successful ghost story writer, comes back from the Great War haunted. Affection comes from her uncle, who gives her her first camera. Through that lens we see Edwardian society London, Weimar Germany, post-Depression America, the British Union of Fascists, the Second World War in France, a Highland estate in post-war decline (Boyd is at his most Waugh-like in this section), Vietnam and drop-out communities in California. It’s the kind of panoramic scope the reader has come to expect from Boyd.\n\nEarly on, she tells her schoolteacher that she wants to live, and it is certainly a replete life. The title is a clever pun – not all the sweet caresses are Amory’s canoodlings – and signals An Issue, which is actually handled with a great deal of sensitivity and tact, and which balances Amory’s determination and impetuosity very skilfully indeed. There is also a very neatly concealed revelation on the last page. I would advise the reader to keep a careful note of the dates, and that even committing the cardinal sin of turning to the last page first won’t reveal it.\n\nThere is a great deal to admire here. Uncle Greville also introduces Amory to a game in which anyone they meet has to be summarised and visualised in just four adjectives. It is especially clever as the reader will find a great many more than four adjectives running through their head in attempting to “fix” Amory’s character; by turns honourable, reckless, naïve, thrawn, tragic, sardonic, gleefully open and mysteriously reserved. \n\nBoyd plays the game himself: in the final pages Amory muses on her “three score years and ten” which “have been rich and intensely sad, fascinating, droll, absurd and terrifying – sometimes – and difficult and painful and happy. Complicated, in other words”. The “four adjective rule” allows the minor characters a degree of depth.\n\nCuriously, many of the best passages forgo the grand sweep of history altogether. Amory’s father, before the war, does handstands to entertain his daughters, walking around and saying, “I look at you girls hanging from your feet like bats and I feel sorry for you, oh, yes, in your topsy-turvy world with the earth above and the sky below”. It’s a charming vignette, suffused with melancholy – he never does handstands after the war – and its view of the world turned upside down spidering out through the narrative. \n\nIn one of the later sections, set in the 1970s with Amory living in a Highland cottage, she has a conversation with a neighbour, a retired astrophysicist. Explaining the problems with the Standard Model of cosmology, she tells Amory about dark matter and dark energy, those postulates that “explain the things that don’t add up, in theory”. Boyd gets in his rebuttal early – the astrophysicist immediately gripes about the appropriation of hard science into metaphor, but Amory runs with it anyway, imagining “dark” love (why you fell and feel for the wrong person), “dark” illness, “dark” politics. “The ‘dark’ concept explains why you can’t explain things,” she says. “It’s wonderfully liberating. Why won’t my car start this morning? It started yesterday. ‘Dark’ auto-engineering… You see, the ‘standard model’ of the human condition just doesn’t work either.” \n\nThis is quite beautiful. Boyd is one of the only novelists I can imagine who might write a whole novel set during a dinner party where interesting, witty, memorable things could occur. In a way, his most famous “hook” – the swathe of great events – is the part he needs least. I would never regret the very pleasant afternoon I spent reading this novel. But there is something so polished and smooth-running about it as to seem almost disingenuous. It might not stall or misfire, but one never feels the accelerator being pushed to the floor either. \n\nIt might be the chutzpah of introducing real historical figures is missing, or the shimmer of criminality. It is nevertheless supremely accomplished, in both the positive and negative senses that word can bear.\n\nTrigger Mortis\n\nAnthony Horowitz\n\nOrion, £18.99\n\nIN THE latest of the Bond novels written after Ian Fleming’s death, Anthony Horowitz continues the franchise. He isn’t the first but he did have an advantage; a 500-word unfinished extract written by Fleming involving a car racing plot was passed on by the author’s estate. The piece is in Horowitz’s finished novel, Trigger Mortis, but it is impossible to see the join.\n\nHis novel is reverential to the Bond books, not the films, so don’t expect any 1970s leather blouson jackets. This is dark but stylish mid-Cold War Britain as the space race hots up. The story starts with our hero in bed with none other than Pussy Galore, dating the action two weeks after the death of her cohort and his arch-enemy, Auric Goldfinger.\n\nFortunately for our old commitment-phobe a new mission is soon presented which involves Bond leaving Pussy and learning to drive a Formula One car to enter a race in Nürburgring and foil murderous SMERSH agents. There he meets the evil Korean businessman, Sin Jai-Seong, and his next love interest, Jeopardy Lane. \n\nThere follows sex, violence and cocktail instructions with all the elements necessary for Bond – the spy slipping uninvited into his enemy’s glamorous party and the complicated method by which Sin means to dispatch him after a revelation of a world domination plan. Alongside, there is enough period sexism and casual racism to take the modern reader’s breath away – Bond says he prefers his women resistant, not compliant, and attributes character according to racial stereotype. \n\nThere are missteps. I presume that Horowitz chose to ignore the lampooning of the Austin Powers films. Why else would he include Bond musing on the impact of the deaths of henchmen? And at one point 007 thanks Jeopardy for “always being there for him”, which invokes more cringe than the punny title.\n\nBut such rare lapses perhaps go to illustrate that this is a fitting sequel to the Fleming novels. It would be easy to dismiss as the light reading enjoyed by your average Top Gear audience, but even if that is true, it is an enjoyable offering.\n\nKirsty McLuckie\n\nChildren Of The Master\n\nAndrew Marr\n\nHarperCollins, £18.99\n\nGIVEN that this book has been written by one of Britain’s foremost journalists, it was perhaps appropriate that this review was done in the finest journalistic traditions – with a couple of drinks on board and perilously close to deadline.\n\nSo it’s just as well that, far from sending you to sleep, Marr’s second novel is something of a page-turner. Overlooking the odd irritating literary flourish, it benefits from an entertaining and fluent style as well as the sort of mastery of Machiavellian political machination that one would expect of someone from his background.\n\nSet in the near future, the two main characters in this political thriller about a Labour leadership race are a Blairite lesbian politician and a Scottish Labour MP (something of an endangered species these days) from Ayrshire.\n\nMarr successfully blends fact with fiction freely to create a convincing political landscape that will be instantly recognisable to those with even the most cursory interest in current affairs.\n\nThe fallout from the No vote in the Scottish independence referendum still lingers and Britain has voted to leave the EU (we’ll have to wait to find out what happens on that one).\n\nThere are disgraced bankers, old-fashioned Labour fixers with questionable morals, a narcissistic newspaper columnist, corruption and memories of a terrible massacre of Scottish children linked to the cover-up of a paedophile sex-ring and its connections to a Tory politician.\n\nThe Master is a former Labour prime minister who was once good at winning elections but has grown impatient with the leftwards direction taken by the party (sound familiar?).\n\nAmid the intrigue there are some excellent jokes and the plot bounces along merrily. An entertaining interlude about the vagaries of the newspaper industry takes some delicious swipes at some of the real-life characters within – which couldn’t fail to amuse this fellow political hack.\n\nTom Peterkin

0058_8a8e4676-af8a-4695-816c-7f429555bc46	"OPINION: Malcolm Turnbull's prime ministership is a chance to unify Australia by leading from the centre, something Tony Abbott was never able to achieve. \n\nAbbott wore a blue tie every day of his rule, the first time a prime minister has worn partisan badging as a permanent personal identification. \n\nHe was never able to achieve what Abbott himself described as the task of an incoming prime minister, making the transition from ""tribal chief to national leader"". \n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Who is Malcolm Turnbull? \n\n* How the internet reacted * * * The result was that the centre of the electorate, where elections are won and lost, abandoned Abbott. For 18 consecutive months, his government has been in a losing position in the polls. \n\nMost Liberals concluded that this was a permanent condition and, filled with despair, turned to Turnbull. \n\nTurnbull has long been the most popular politician in Australia, and more popular with Labor and Greens voters than with Liberals. \n\nHe intends to govern from what he calls the ""sensible centre"", socially progressive but economically conservative. \n\nThe harder part for Turnbull will be whether he can unify his own party. \n\nThat is key to the success of his prime ministership. And that is why Scott Morrison is pivotal to the Turnbull project. \n\nTurnbull's last term as Liberal leader failed precisely because he lost the support of the party's right wing, which revolted over his plan to support Kevin Rudd's emissions trading scheme. \n\nThe hard right of the Liberal Party would prefer Morrison as leader and is angry at what they see as Turnbull's treachery. \n\nBut Morrison has resisted all approaches, knowing that he is not ready for the leadership. In surveys asking voters for their preferred Liberal leader, Morrison routinely polls a mere 3 to 5 per cent. Ad Feedback Morrison is a relatively young 46 and likes to say that he's a very patient man. \n\nWhile he decided to vote for Abbott in the leadership challenge, he is also expected to work with a successful Turnbull bid. \n\nIf Morrison can help to mediate between the resentful right and the famous Turnbull intemperance, the government will stand a much better chance of presenting a unified front. \n\nThe advent of Turnbull is not just a personnel change. He will want to move the government to a more active stance on climate change and gay marriage. Anything less will disappoint the electorate. The trick will be to do this without alienating the party's right. \n\nIsn't a looming election, expected with a year, enough to keep the party unified and dissenters disciplined under its new leader? \n\nJulia Gillard counted on just such reasoning. She misjudged. Unity and discipline is not guaranteed. \n\nIf unity is to be a challenge for Turnbull, it will soon be the all-encompassing preoccupation for Labor's leader, Bill Shorten. \n\nShorten has never faced a popular prime minister. That now changes. \n\nShorten's leadership will come under tremendous pressure as the polls shift in favour of the government. - Sydney Morning Herald"

0060_8b2248de-96d1-4d0c-bac1-6370dd01b7bf	The League/Facebook \n \nThe League’s founder, Amanda Bradford. \n    \nThe League, a controversial, selective dating app for successful singles, isn’t for everyone. \n \nThe app launched in San Francisco earlier this year, and a few months ago it launched in New York City . \n \nStanford graduate Amanda Bradford founded The League and, earlier this year,  raised $2.1 million  with the goal of matching up highly motivated single professionals. \n \nThe League is hard to get into — the  only way to get inside the app is by applying to a long waitlist , or by snagging a VIP pass from someone who’s already a member and cutting the line. Someone in San Francisco has even tried selling their VIP pass for $100 on Craigslist . \n \nAt least one Business Insider employee has already made the cut on The League, so we went inside to find out for ourselves what the app is really like to use. \n \n  \n  \n   This is Amanda Bradford. She founded The League with the goal of making power couples by matching up highly motivated single professionals.   \n   The League launched in San Francisco earlier this year, and a few months ago it launched in New York City, too.   \n   Right now the app is still in private beta in New York, but we were able to get a peek inside.   \n   Before you can get into The League, you have to sign up. You’ll be put on a waiting list until you’re approved…   \n   Once you’re finally in and you load the app, here’s the first screen you see.   \n   Loading…   \n   Every day, you’re shown only five potential matches to whom you can say yes or no.   \n   Like Tinder and Hinge, you can swipe right to indicate you’re interested in someone or swipe left if you’d like to pass. Tap the icon on the top right corner to see your matches.   \n   The League puts all your matches in one place. But unlike other dating apps, your matches on The League have an expiration date. If you don’t respond within three weeks, your match will disappear. You can also sort your matches by “best match,”  “recent,” “popular,” and “least flaky.”   \n   Every user on The League has a “concierge” who answers your questions about the app and lets you know about in-app updates.   \n   Users set their preferences for matches. The League’s big promise is that you’re only shown other users who fit your specific criteria, and your profile will only be shown to others that fit your criteria, too. That criteria, apparently, includes gender, age, height, distance, education, and ethnicity.   \n   Here’s Business Insider producer Sam Rega’s profile. You can see where he’s based (New York), his age and height, and his education, profession, and interests. Tap on the icon on the top left corner and you’ll be shown the app’s menu.   \n   Here’s Sam’s profile. You can add pictures of yourself, along with as much or as little biographical information as you’d like.   \n   Other users are shown where you work and your interests, too.   \n   Here’s the full menu. You can look at your potential matches for the day, check out the people you’ve been matched with already, look at your own profile, and more.   \n   Under “settings,” you can see information like how many of your friends are on The League, how many VIP tickets you have (VIP tickets let you invite friends to “jump the line” and get into The League),  and when you joined.   \n   When you’ve exhausted the five people you’ve been shown that day, here’s the message you’re shown. You’re shown a new batch of people each day at 5 pm. Also note the blue dot in the upper right corner — that means you have an alert in your matches, either a new match or new message.   \n   When you match with someone, you can choose to chat with them, or keep swiping through your potential matches.   \n   See the clock symbol in the upper right corner? You can use it to make a match expire, or to essentially unmatch someone. This is the pop-up that appears when you tap the clock symbol.   \n   In terms of app design, The League isn’t all that different from the dating apps you’re probably already familiar with. It’s founder Amanda Bradford’s ultimate goal — matching tons of power couples — that sets it apart.   \n   \nRead more stories on Business Insider , Malaysian edition of the world’s fastest-growing business and technology news website.

0062_b58491e1-10ec-45e5-84ab-251484746f68	[embedded content]  So sad. Adrienne Bailon has called it quits with her fiance, Lenny Santiago, after six years. The actress and the entertainment exec have confirmed that they have ended their engagement, and Adrienne spoke about it on ‘The Real.’  \nAdrienne Bailon , 31, will not walk down the aisle with now-ex fiance,  Lenny Santiago , 44. The couple had been together for an impressive six years, and are coming off of a seven-month engagement . Adrienne has spoken out on the breakup on the Sept. 16 episode of her talk show The Real , expressing her sadness about the breakup, and the love she still has for Lenny. Watch what she had to say! \n \n“My prayer has always been that in not so great moments, you remind yourself that everything in life happens for a reason, and hopefully it will benefit somebody else, it will help somebody else,” she said. “I know a lot of you guys have been asking me… ‘Where is your ring? Are you still engaged?’ and it’s been a very hard decision for me to make… and I am not engaged anymore.”  \n Take Our Poll  \nAw, such a bummer, especially considering the way Adrienne spoke about Lenny at the time of their engagement in February. “I am so excited to be marrying my best friend,” she told  Us . “There’s nothing like having someone that makes you laugh, that encourages you, and motivates you. He’s such an incredible person and they say there’s always a great man behind a great woman and I say the same for him. He’s been that great motivation behind everything I do.” \n \nAdrienne previously dated  Rob Kardashian   back in 2007, and the two broke up publicly in 2009 before Adrienne began dating Lenny. Luckily, Adrienne has a lot of distractions to take her mind off the breakup, including her series, The Real , which you can hear her discuss with us on the  HollywoodLife podcast, right here . \n \nWe’re wishing Adrienne and Lenny the best during this surely difficult time. Are you sad to see the couple split? \n \n— Casey Mink

""We have a trans civil rights problem."" \n\nFor the fourth consecutive year, Julia Louis-Dreyfus won the Emmy for lead actress in a comedy series for her starring turn in HBO's ""Veep,"" about a neglected female vice-president who ascends to the Oval Office. \n\nHer castmate Tony Hale won best supporting actor in a comedy series for playing her loyal political aide. The show also won a writing award. \n\nBut the night's biggest winner may have been ""Olive Kittredge,"" the acclaimed HBO miniseries about 25 years in the life of an acerbic, retired schoolteacher in a seemingly placid Maine town. \n\nIt took home Emmys for best limited series, best actress in a limited series (Frances McDormand, who played the title character), best actor in a limited series (Richard Jenkins, her kindly on-screen husband) and best supporting actor in a limited series (Bill Murray, who didn't show up to claim his award, unfortunately). \n\n""Kittredge"" director Lisa Cholodenko and screenwriter Jane Anderson were also honored. \n\nEarlier, actress Allison Janney won best supporting actress in a comedy for her role in ""Mom,"" in which she plays the overbearing mother of a young adult daughter played by Anna Faris. It was Janney's sixth Emmy; she won five times before for ""The West Wing."" \n\nThe award was presented by Amy Poehler and the ever-provocative Amy Schumer, who quipped, ""Let's not forget what this night is really about -- celebrating hilarious women and letting the Internet weigh in on who looks the worst."" \n\nSchumer won an Emmy for best variety sketch series for her Comedy Central show, ""Inside Amy Schumer,"" which tackles such hot-button topics as misogyny and female sexuality. ""This show fights for what we believe in,"" Schumer said. \n\nIt was also a good night for retiring fake-newsman Jon Stewart, whose ""The Daily Show"" won Emmys for best variety talk series and for its director, Chuck O'Neill. \n\nActor-comedian Andy Samberg is hosting the live show, expected to run til about 11 pm ET on Fox. \n\nThe show opened with Samberg in a video that poked fun at TV's overabundance of buzzed-about shows. After being mocked by friends for not keeping up with popular new series, Samberg locks himself in a bunker and watches nothing but TV for a year until he emerges, hairy and wild-eyed, to annoy everyone around him. \n\nSamberg then did a brief monologue in which he cracked jokes about diversity in Hollywood, Paula Deen on ""Dancing With the Stars"" and -- inevitably -- presidential candidate Donald Trump. \n\n""Donald Trump is running for president, to the delight of uncles everywhere,"" Samberg said. ""And is it just me, or does Bernie Sanders always look like his flight is delayed?"" \n\nThe Television Academy will hand out awards in 25 categories, culminating with the night's two biggest prizes: outstanding comedy and drama series. ""Game of Thrones,"" ""American Horror Story: Freak Show,"" ""House of Cards"" and ""Transparent"" top the list of shows with the most nominations. \n\nFor those keeping score, HBO leads all networks with 126 nominations (HBO is a unit of Time Warner, as is CNN). Far behind in second is ABC with 42, followed by CBS and NBC with 41 each. \n\nThe Television Academy announced new rules this year that allows all 15,000 academy members, not just smaller groups, to vote for awards -- a change some observers believe could benefit shows with large fan bases such as ""Game of Thrones."""
0064_bada8ea1-639f-4e76-bfc6-a801cfb4a635	"Well, that was quick: an economist whose research was cited by the Wall Street Journal in its scare-number piece on Bernie Sanders has hit back, saying that single-payer health care would save Americans nearly $5 trillion over 10 years. The Journal, you may remember, said ZOMG SANDURZEZ PROGRAMZ WOULD COST TEH 18 TRILLYUNZ OF DOLLARZ!!!!! not too long ago. Further, ""(t)hese financial savings would be felt by businesses and by state and local governments who would no longer be paying for health insurance for their employees; and by retirees and working Americans who would no longer have to pay for their health insurance or for co-payments and deductibles."" Of course, Americans would be ""paying for it,"" with their taxes, and corporations would be paying less, not nothing, but they're still trenchant points. Ho hum, the House Ways and Means Committee votes to make some $38 billion in annual corporate tax breaks permanent. They've had trouble passing this mass of corporate welfare for more than two years at a time -- possibly because when ordinary Americans hear that these tax breaks enable big corporations to pretend their profits are all overseas but their expenses are all here in America, they hate them. Sen. Sanders proposes a national ban on private prisons, which federal, state, and local governments would have three years to accomplish. Mr. Sanders would also bring back the federal parole system -- abolished in 1984 by men who feared everyone would find their penises inadequate -- and ending the minimum on how many immigrants the ICE must detain at one time, a quota that sure sounds like a way of making some crony corporation money. And unlike Messrs. Clinton and O'Malley, no one will be able to accuse Mr. Sanders of suddenly turning on a notion that's benefited his career for years.Kim Zetter, writing for Wired, explains ""ransomware,"" where evil bastards can lock you out of your computer if you don't pay them a ransom. The individuals who allege that you possess child porn and then ask for a few hundred dollars to make the charges go away really deserve their own circle of hell. How to defend against them as best you can? Use anti-virus software and back up your files somewhere off-net. Oldheads already know this, of course. Finally, also from the ""ho hum"" file: Bristol Palin blogs that President Obama ""needs to STAY out of"" the Ahmed Mohamed case, and adds that Mr. Obama's invitation for Mr. Mohamed to come to the White House is a ""childish game()"" that ""invites more racial strife."" Never mind the people who actually create racial strife -- a bold person like Ms. Palin has the vision to blame those who ""invite"" their behavior, as if folks creating racial strife are simply powerless to stop their behavior on their own! And someone who employs shouty-caps should know all about ""childish games."" I wonder where she learned about them."
0065_bb18d0f8-f41f-4850-92a1-da53237dd6fd	Clinton says she opposes Keystone pipeline \n \nDES MOINES, Iowa — Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday she opposes construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, breaking her longstanding silence over a project criticized by environmentalists as a threat to the planet’s climate. \n \nThe Democratic presidential candidate said she decided to speak out after concluding the ongoing debate over whether the pipeline should be built had become a distraction to larger efforts to fight climate change. \n \nThat distraction, she said, is “unfortunately, from my perspective, one that interferes with our ability to move forward to deal with the other issues. Therefore I oppose it.” \n \nClinton’s announcement came as she has ceded ground in some polls to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has long opposed the project. It also followed the appearance of protesters at some of her recent campaign events holding signs that read, “I’m Ready for Hillary to say no KXL.” \n \nThe former secretary of state had previously said she shouldn’t take a position on the issue, because she didn’t want to interfere with the Obama administration as it considers whether to allow construction of a pipeline that would transport oil from Canada’s tar sands to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. \n \nFrom wire reports \n \nThe announcement was viewed with disappointment in Canada, where Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said as recently as last month that he was confident the next U.S. president would approve the project. \n \n“This is not a debate between Canada and the U.S.,” said Stephen Lecce, a spokesman for Harper. “We know the American people support the project. We will not engage in presidential primary debates.” \n \nLess reluctant was Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, who said on Twitter that Clinton’s decision proves she “favors environmental extremists over U.S. jobs.” \n \nSpurred on by environmental activists and liberals who play a key role in the Democratic primaries and vigorously oppose the pipeline project, Clinton had expressed impatience in recent weeks over the Obama administration’s drawn-out deliberations. \n \nHer campaign said the White House was briefed on Clinton’s position prior to her comments and she privately made her opposition to the pipeline known when she discussed her plans with labor officials in recent weeks. \n \nClinton is scheduled to raise money in California over three days beginning Sunday and was sure to face questions from donors on why she had yet to stake out a position. \n \nTom Steyer, a leading environmentalist and top Democratic donor, said it was a “clear example of people power overcoming the special interests” and credited Clinton for joining with “thousands of Americans calling on President Obama to reject the Keystone XL pipeline in favor of building an American economy powered by clean energy.” \n \nReince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Clinton was being “blatantly dishonest” when she said her role at the State Department had prevented her from taking a position. Concern about Vice President Joe Biden political future played a role, too, he said. \n \n“Clearly, Hillary Clinton’s rapid decline in the polls and the prospect of the vice president entering the race caused her to change course,” Priebus said in a statement. \n \nClinton announced her decision moments after Pope Francis arrived in Washington at the start of a closely watched visit to the United States. Her opposition came in response to a question from a Drake University student attending a forum on prescription drugs. \n \n“I was in a unique position having been secretary of state, having started this process and not wanting to interfere with the ongoing decision making,” Clinton said. “I thought this would be decided by now and therefore I could tell you whether I agree or disagree. But it hasn’t been decided and I feel now I’ve got a responsibility to you and other voters who ask me about this.” \n \nClinton’s main rivals for the Democratic nomination have campaigned against the project. Sanders, who has surpassed Clinton in some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, said in a statement he was “glad that Secretary Clinton finally has made a decision and I welcome her opposition to the pipeline. Clearly it would be absurd to encourage the extraction and transportation of some of the dirtiest fossil fuel on the planet.” \n \nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who trails Clinton and Sanders by a wide margin in polls, used the moment to criticize the Democratic front-runner, saying her late-breaking opposition to Keystone is akin to how she arrived at her positions on gay marriage, offering driver’s licenses for people not living in the country legally and the Syrian refugee crisis. \n \n“On issue after issue,” O’Malley said in a statement, “Secretary Clinton has followed — not forged — public opinion. Leadership is about stating where you stand on critical issues, regardless of how they poll or focus group.” \n \nClinton said she would roll out a plan aimed at fighting climate change in a few days and noted proposals released earlier in the campaign that would bolster solar energy and produce more renewable energy. \n \nShe said the nation had “a lot of work to do” and that shifting to more renewable energy would create jobs.

0067_af1a027e-6d32-4d90-a28a-802269cf1dd7	JUDY WOODRUFF: In other news, European leaders are promising new efforts to process thousands of refugees and migrants reaching Greece and Italy. \n \nThe agreement early today also includes more than a billion dollars in aid for those still in refugee camps in the Middle East. \n \nMeanwhile, the crisis stoked new tensions along Serbia’s border with Croatia. Long lines of cargo trucks backed up as the rival nations cut off imports and blocked traffic in a war of words over the flow of refugees. \n \nZORAN MILANOVIC, Prime Minister, Croatia (through interpreter): All that the Serbian prime minister has to do is to stop this flow of migrants, 9,000 in one day. We cannot make 50 refugee camps at the border. What we have done so far is good, and we can cope with 4,000, 5,000 a day, but above that, no. \n \nNEBOJSA STEFANOVIC, Serbian Interior Minister (through interpreter): Croatia is behaving irresponsibly. By imposing this economic aggression, they are hurting the economy of both countries. Serbia is forced to introduce countermeasures. We are not happy about it, but we have to protect our state and our sovereignty. \n \nJUDY WOODRUFF: More than 40,000 migrants have entered Croatia from Serbia over the last nine days. \n \nGWEN IFILL: The president of China arrived in Washington this evening for a highly anticipated state visit. Xi Jinping’s plane touched down at Joint Base Andrews, after flying cross-country from Seattle. He was greeted by Vice President and Mrs. Biden. Xi has a private dinner with President Obama tonight. He will be formally welcomed tomorrow. \n \nJUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Obama will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday in New York for the first time in nearly a year. The Kremlin said today the focus will be Syria and coordinating the fight there against Islamic State forces. \n \nBut White House spokesman Josh Earnest charged again that Russia’s military buildup will do far more harm than good. \n \nJOSH EARNEST, White House Press Secretary: President Obama will make it clear once again that Russia doubling down on their support for the Assad regime is a losing bet. The likely consequence of them doing so is only to deepen and expand the ongoing crisis in that country. That doesn’t serve the interests of either the Russian people or the American people. \n \nJUDY WOODRUFF: Earnest said Russia’s involvement in Ukraine will be President Obama’s top item. The talks will follow Putin’s address to the U.N. General Assembly. \n \nGWEN IFILL: In Yemen, an Islamic State affiliate claimed an attack that killed 25 Muslims at prayer today. The suicide bombing wrecked a mosque in Sanaa, as worshipers observed the holiday of Eid al Adha. The bomber set off a smaller explosion, then blew himself up as people ran for the exits. \n \nJUDY WOODRUFF: The government of Colombia and that country’s largest rebel group now say their long-running conflict will end in the next six months. The two sides announced the deal last night in Havana, Cuba, where peace talks took place. A final agreement would end more than 50 years of fighting. The United States welcomed the deal, but Colombia’s conservative political opposition condemned it. \n \nGWEN IFILL: The scandal over Volkswagen cheating on emissions tests is expanding again. In Berlin today, Germany’s transport minister confirmed that rigged V.W.s expanded beyond the U.S. \n \nALEXANDER DOBRINDT , German Transport Minister (through interpreter): We were informed by Volkswagen that there are vehicles with 1.6-liter and 2-liter diesel engines in Europe affected by the manipulations. That is why we will continue to work intensely together with Volkswagen in order to determine what cars exactly are involved. \n \nGWEN IFILL: Eleven million Volkswagen cars worldwide were fitted with the software responsible for the emissions cheating. \n \nJUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this country, the Senate balked again at defunding Planned Parenthood as the price of preventing a government shutdown. Republican conservatives have pushed that plan. But they once again came up short of the 60 votes needed to advance a bill, but only after the two parties traded broadsides. \n \nSEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), Minority Leader: By inserting into this debate a meaningless, losing attack on women as just a waste of time, but they decided, the Republicans have decided once again to place partisan, ideological agendas over the well-being of the nation. \n \nSEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority Leader: There’s no reason to continue blocking every attempt to fund the government or to protect political allies that are mired in scandal. So, I’m calling on colleagues across the aisle to join us in standing against a shutdown. I’m calling on them to join us in standing up for women’s health instead. \n \nJUDY WOODRUFF: Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, as you heard, is saying he opposes shutting the government. He’s now expected to offer a so-called clean bill to fund operations throughDecember 11. It’s not clear whether House Republicans will go along. \n \nGWEN IFILL: The world’s largest maker of construction equipment, Caterpillar, will cut as many as 10,000 jobs through 2018. The announcement today is the latest sign of a worldwide slowdown in mining and energy exploration. And that, in turn, held Wall Street back. The Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 80 points to close back near 16200. The Nasdaq fell 18 points. And the S&P 500 dropped six. \n \nThe post News Wrap: EU strikes agreement on migrant crisis aid appeared first on PBS NewsHour .

0069_a8a198c1-5d16-4f68-93f5-4254edd1fd97	I remember the first time I became consciously aware of my fat attraction. I was sixteen, sitting on the couch with my high school boyfriend watching Ruben Studdard sing “Ain’t Too Proud to Beg” on American Idol . My boyfriend was skinny and white, with dyed blue-black hair, and I loved him, as much as an emotionally-embryonic teenager can love someone. I loved him, and I loved fucking him, but watching this 400-pound man on the TV stirred something in me. I wanted his body next to mine. I gave my boyfriend a hand-job, and imagined what Ruben’s heavy embrace would feel like, something like a down comforter mixed with a hot bath. \n \n“It’s not a fetish,” I sometimes find myself explaining. I don’t exclusively fuck fat people, just like I don’t exclusively fuck black people. Out of the—one, two, give me a minute—nine people I’ve slept with or dated this year, three have been fat. Last year I dated two men who you might classify as “obese” and who I classify as “some of the best sex I’ve ever had.” The fact that I even have to qualify my attraction to them outside of fetishization is fucked up and depressing, but that’s the world we live in. Most people are so conditioned to view fat bodies as undesirable that those of us who desire them are automatically labeled deviants. \n\n \nI should probably admit right now that I am fat myself. I’m barely 5′1″ and 135 pounds and wear a size 6 and a 34DD and I’m sure there are many people who wouldn’t call me fat. But I refuse to think of the word “fat” as a negative term. I hate when I make an offhanded comment about being fat, and someone immediately says, “You’re not fat!” as if to consider myself fat is the worst, most self-hating thing in the goddamn world. I’m certainly not thin or skinny, and I grew up thinking of myself as a fat person—I have what I like to call “fat kid brain.” And now that I’ve come to accept and love that part of who I am, thanks to friends and partners and therapy and a career as a nude art model, I’m loathe to let go of that aspect of my identity. I also absolutely have body dysmorphia, which, in conjunction with my anxiety disorder, more often manifests as an issue of perception—whether or not I’m okay with being fat, I never know how other people see me, because I can’t trust what my brain tells me is being displayed in the mirror. It’s one reason why I love Instagram and take so many selfies—it’s the only way I can see myself through other peoples’ eyes. The only way I can ask, “I love my fat body—do you?” And the answer is almost always yes. A big part of learning to think of myself as beautiful was realizing that many of the women I am attracted to are as fat as I am, if not more. And if I want to be with a fat girl, surely there are people out there who want to be with me. \n  \n   \nAnd duh, there are plenty . \n \nIf you’ve never fucked a fat person, take a minute and ask yourself why. Is it that you truly find their bodies ugly? Are you afraid that fat stigma is going to rub off on you, that people will see you loving a fat person and think that means there’s something wrong with you? Are you fat and unhappy with your own body? Are you not-fat and unhappy with your own body? Has the media conditioned you to believe that sex with fat people is somehow more difficult and less enjoyable (spoiler: it’s not)? Or is it that you have fucked a fat person but insisted to yourself or to them that they’re not fat, instead of telling them what part of their fatness you consider sexy? \n \nI could rhapsodize about the feel of soft skin and flesh you can dig your nails into, about men and women with barrel chests and wide asses and round faces and strong arms. But, as choice as I find it, the hotness of fat people is something you have to discover for yourself. \n \nThe other part of loving fat bodies is realizing that, for people socially coded as undesirable for any reason, a fair amount of narcissism is a healthy and necessary thing. In the immortal words of RuPaul, “If you can’t love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?” And this is an issue that I struggle with all of the time. Because I am attracted to fat people, and I am also attracted to people who aren’t drowning in a sea of self-loathing. I don’t want someone who wants to change everything about themselves. I don’t want someone who thinks they can’t have style because they’re fat. I don’t want someone who believes the lie that clothes that highlight their fatness are unflattering. I don’t want someone who doesn’t think fat people can be sexy. I want to be able to give the person who makes me wet a compliment and have them say, “Thank you,” instead of “Ugh, whatever, you’re just saying that”. \n \nI’m not saying that feeling positively about fat bodies, be they your own or someone else’s, is easy. It takes real work to break down the connections in our brain that equate fatness with guilt and shame and ugliness and blame. This is one reason why it’s crucial for there to be an increasingly wider representation of body types in media, and for those representations to be nuanced. It’s one reason why Mindy Kaling’s success, and her show’s depiction of a not-thin woman of color as an intelligent, complicated, and desirable woman who dates all kinds of men is important. There’s this weird standard for on-screen relationships that bleeds out into our everyday lives: that if one person is a certain level of culturally-determined hotness, their partner should be equally hot. That a “10″ should only date other “10s,” as it were. This is not how attraction works. And the unfortunate dialogue that reinforces the idea that some people “aren’t good enough” for us and that others are “out of our league” is probably keeping a fair amount of us from having a healthy relationship with someone with whom we are both intellectually and physically compatible. \n \nThere have been many articles that call attention to the TV husband whose wife is “too hot” for him. I would link to some of them but I...don’t want to, so if you’re interested in substantive proof and/or getting really depressed about male body shaming, you can do what I did and Google “tv husband too fat”. One piece from 2010 opens—sincerely, unironically, and humorlessly—with the line, “In real life, fat guys never get the girl.” Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck yoooooooou. Fuck anyone who has fed into this system that keeps men from believing that women like me exist. And if your argument is that we see fat husbands with thin wives but not the other way around, the solution to that problem is not to body shame fat men—instead, let’s use the fuel of our outrage to get more fat women with diversely hot partners on television. \n \nI once spent a summer in love with a fat friend. We would hang out at his place, watching Freaks and Geeks while I rhapsodized about my crush on chubby, jewfro-ed Seth Rogen. At some point, when I couldn’t take any more late nights spent smoking blunts and pressing my cleavage against his chest and wishing he would just kiss me, I finally said to him, “I am attracted to you in a multitude of ways. How do you feel about that?” He didn’t know. He sent me an email about “valuing his friendships with women” that at the time felt like a classic blow-off. A year later he apologized for how he handled the situation: “I didn’t think of myself as attractive, so I didn’t know what to do when you told me that. I didn’t trust that what you were saying could be true, so I freaked out and pushed you away.” Because of his body shame we both ended up hurt and unhappy, we lost the chance for a romantic relationship, and our tight-knit friendship suffered as well. \n \nI’ve always been an impatient, make-the-first-move kind of girl, but I have a rule against doing that now. I need to be with someone who I know is confident enough to read my blatantly encouraging signals and act on their desire for me. I need someone who doesn’t second-guess my attraction for them, who can look at themselves in the mirror and see a lovable, fuckable, hot-ass body. Yes, I fuck fat people and skinny people and everyone in between—but I only fuck people who don’t hate themselves. Just think of what could happen if we all work a little harder to see and express and depict and acknowledge the endless spectrum of human beauty the world has been gracious enough to give us. We might find ourselves with more—more joy, more orgasms, more opportunities, more love. And a little more can be a very good thing. \n \nEloise LeBel is a Los Angeles-based writer of various concerns, including her blog Sexistential Questions .

0070_b023c0e4-52e9-4d77-a41c-0a3bfa3b3a7d	Dwyer’s View: Enjoy the mometBob DwyerSeptember 16, 2015I’m excited to be going to the Rugby World Cup and it certainly brings back memories of 1991. It’s really not like any other rugby tour  – the feeling when you arrive in the place is that the whole country is alive with anticipation. All of the towns and cities where the teams are based have that feeling of excitement and it gets picked up by the squads. If you approach it in the right way – to have the ‘on/off’ switch – you can really enjoy yourself (sensibly of course). It’s like nothing else and you shouldn’t miss out on the occasion. Having said that you also have as a team squad member to understand that every team there is going to put on its absolutely best performance; having prepared with 28 years of experience (since 1987) of how you prepare for such a tournament. Normally the Wallabies wouldn’t be that concerned about playing Fiji – they have ability but over 80 minutes of a test match we can handle them – but we certainly won’t be going into the first match that way. Fiji are better prepared than ever before. I’ll be keen to see them against England and then on the 23rd. I’ve got great expectations for our team. Sure they can win it (theoretically any team can), but to really do so you need high class players at their best, team-work at its best and you can’t afford an off day. What I can say is that personally I’m confident that the coaching staff and team admin understand their roles very, very well. I’m impressed with the whole coaching staff – it’s as good as anyone is going to have. Cheika has also shown that he’s very good at tournament rugby. He gets them to their best when the best is needed- as shown at Leinster. I’m also encouraged that over the last 12 months he’s been gradually refining the squad to where it is now. View image | gettyimages.com If there’s anything that’s had me a little concerned is that I don’t see that either of our 9s are playing at their technical best. Both have a backswing and move sideways – Phipps does more the former and Genia more the latter. I hope that Steve Larkham has noted it and removed it from the game of two potentially very good players; it’s critically important that we don’t give anyone the chance to disrupt us in the the transition zone from tight to wide. Outside of that I have no great concerns about the team. The scrum is first class – better than anyone in our pool. If reffed properly, we’ll have no problem. With Douglas, Simmons, Fardy – even Hooper or Pocock taking a ball – our line-out will be in good shape as well. I remember well in 1991 we always said that as a team going into the tournament “we believe if we play to the best of our ability we can give any team a shake” and we can genuinely say that now. All we have to do is play to the best of our ability . Some people think our pool is a difficult assignment, but succeeding it leaves us in great shape. If we’re going to go anywhere in the tournament we’ve got to be able to beat Fiji and it gives us a good lead up into England and Wales. It’s an exciting time for us and we’ve got reason to be able to hope our team can play to their best of their ability. As for competition should we progress, over the last few years England have improved, but then in the last few months gone backwards. Can they turn it around? One of the traditionally great tournament teams has certainly been South Africa who can lift, but they haven’t looked good in the lead up. In 1995 New Zealand looked far and away the best team in the comp, but then South Africa played over New Zealand for the whole of the final. In 2007 they managed to beat one team after another to win (what was a lacklustre tournament to be fair). They haven’t looked great this season but will  be there or there abouts. View image | gettyimages.com France struggled totally in 2011 losing two games along the way but then were very unlucky to not be champions, save for a couple of refereeing decisions. Wales have been consistently good but always the bridesmaid and it’s hard to think they can overcome the loss of Halfpenny and Webb. Halfpenny is surely the world’s number 1 fullback with his goal kicking. Webb has risen to being a world class scrum half. How can they survive the loss of both? It’s down to the usual suspects – the three southern hemisphere teams, England and France. I’ve left Ireland out because I haven’t been impressed with their trials at all. They’r really struggling to re-build a three-quarter line bar Rob Kearney. I can’t see who’s going to come through there. How do you win a world cup without one? Shocks? I can see Fiji producing one. I’m not sure of anyone else. Above all the rugby world cup is a celebration of the game and we should approach the tournament that way. Some people say they’re not sure how far Australian can go, should they buy finals tickets? But it’s about the world game and the excitement for all the countries. It’s not just about your team winning, but them all doing their best – otherwise there’s no point in 60% of the teams going at all. Just enjoy it for what it is – a special tournament indeed.

I want to thank all of you. We are very proud that the International community has acted responsibly in such a way,"" he said. \n \nHe also announced that the United States will double the troops, helicopters, training and defence articles for the peacekeeping operations. \n \n""As the largest contributor to peacekeeping operations, I am issuing new US directives, double US officers. More than 50 countries are committing 30,000 new troops and police and they are stepping up with helicopters and medical units, this represents significant progress,"" Obama said. \n \nThe US President, however, added that peace operations are not the solution to all problems and stressed on acknowledging that the 'abuse' by peacekeepers has to end. \n \nThis came in the wake of the UN being badly shaken by a string of sexual abuse claims targeting its peacekeepers, in particular in the Central African Republic where many of the 17 allegations involve underage victims as young as 11. \n \nBan Ki-moon had warned that he was ready to throw out entire peacekeeping units if their country fails to take action against soldiers accused of sexual abuse, according to reports. \n \nThe warning was among a series of measures unveiled by the UN chief at a meeting with the 124 countries that contribute troops and police to the UN peace missions worldwide. \n \n""Mr Secretary General, we commend you for raising this issue. We have to ask for zero tolerance on this issue and we need to improve protection of civilians as the current guidelines are being implemented unevenly,"" Obama added. \n \nHe assured that if the steps that he had announced were embraced, then it would strengthen the peace operations for the decades to come. \n \n""The decision and the commitments that we make today can help ensure that our peacekeepers have success in their mission.

0075_f3a97d44-fd87-4e28-b771-4d3481c6a50e	"(CNN) -  \nLaw enforcement officers continued to search Thursday for three men suspected of killing Fox Lake police Lt. Joe Gliniewicz. The suspects have been described only as two white men and one black man. \n\nGliniewicz was a hero to many in Fox Lake, a community of about 10,000 people in northern Illinois. Hundreds of people gathered Wednesday night for a vigil to honor the 30-year police veteran. He led the local police explorers' program, mentoring and training youths who are interested in becoming officers. \n\nHe was also a husband and father of four. \n \n""Joe was my best friend and my world. My hero,"" Melodie Gliniewicz told more than 1,000 people at the candlelight vigil Wednesday evening. \n\nShe said her husband was ""the love of my life for the last 26½ years. He was my rock as much as I was his rock."" \n\nThe last day of work \n\nGliniewicz was on his way to work Tuesday morning, in the cruiser that he had taken home the day before, when he saw three suspicious people, Lake County Major Crime Task Force Cmdr. George Filenko said. \n\nThis would not have been unusual as Gliniewicz was the type of officer who considered himself on duty as soon as he rolled into town, Filenko said. \n\nThe lieutenant made the first call at 7:52 a.m. and called three minutes later to request backup. The backup units arrived at 8:01 and found their fellow officer dead, roughly 50 yards from his vehicle, at 8:09, Filenko said. \n\nAuthorities initially marked off a 2-square-mile area across tricky terrain and brought in helicopters, K-9 units, federal agents, night-vision equipment and body-heat sensors. Police cleared every home in the cordoned-off area and fielded more than 100 tips, Filenko said. \n\nOn Wednesday, they widened the search area. \n\nSo far, police have found no witnesses, but they are reviewing surveillance tapes from area buildings. \n\n""Videos are coming from a number of places. Businesses. Factories. Gas stations,"" Filenko said. \n\nThey also have one video from a truck driver who had a camera in his vehicle and was in the area Tuesday. \n\nAn autopsy was completed, but authorities aren't releasing the results yet, Filenko said. The Northern Illinois Police Crime Laboratory is expediting its review of evidence to determine whether there was any fingerprint or DNA transfer. \n\nTechnicians should have that analysis finished within a ""day or so,"" he said. \n\nA challenging search \n\nThe FBI, U.S. Marshals and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives joined in the hunt. More than 400 law enforcement officers raked through the heavy woods near Fox Lake on foot, all-terrain vehicles and horseback. \n\nLocal police officers have volunteered to come in while they're off duty, and other law enforcement officers in the surrounding area have called to offer their assistance, Filenko said. \n\nAsked whether he had a deadline for calling off the search, Filenko said, ""I'm not going to set a time limit on this. I have a murdered colleague. ... We're not going to stop."" \n\nFollowing a false lead \n\nOn Wednesday night, an Illinois woman sent 100 officers scrambling after saying she saw two men who fit the description of the cop killers police have been looking for. \n\nBut after hours of searching, police said, they discovered she had made the whole story up. \n\n""It's very disappointing because our resources could have been used somewhere else,"" Lake County Sheriff's Detective Christopher Covelli said early Thursday morning. \n\nOn Wednesday night, Kristin B. Kiefer, 30, called police and said she was driving and pulled over near a cornfield because she was having car trouble, Covelli said. \n\nKiefer told officers a white man and a black man tried to get in her car, Covelli said. She said when she picked up her phone to call police, the two men fled into the cornfield. \n\nMore than 100 federal, state and local law enforcement officers descended on the area overnight. Eleven K-9 officers and three aircraft also responded to the tip. \n\nBut Kiefer later admitted she fabricated the story because she was looking for attention, Covelli said. \n\nShe was charged with two counts of disorderly conduct -- one felony, one misdemeanor -- due to the false report, the detective said. \n\nKiefer was being held Thursday morning at the Lake County jail and is scheduled to have a bond hearing later in the day."
0076_cfad6032-8b09-45ef-84bd-bec07e5afe0c	Ireland have received a significant World Cup boost with prop Cian Healy passed fit to start after neck surgery. \n\nLoosehead prop Healy has battled neck problems since May, but has recovered just in time and will be available for Saturday’s Pool D opener against Canada. \n\n \n\nScrum-half Conor Murray has been passed fit after concussion, with Rob Kearney also over knee niggles for the Cardiff clash with Canada. \n\nIreland team manager Mick Kearney admitted Healy endured “a degree of pessimism” earlier in the summer, fearing he would miss the World Cup, before grafting his way back to fitness. \n\n“The 31-man squad are all fit and available for selection against Canada for Saturday,” said Ireland team co-ordinator Kearney. \n\n“Cian’s great, obviously Cian had a few dark days across the summer but towards the end of August he made fantastic progress. \n\n“He’s been in full training for the last two weeks and I’m delighted to report that he is available for selection at the weekend against Canada. \n\n“I think the fact that he is available and is fit I think it’s a huge boost to everyone in the squad and a huge boost to Cian as well. \n\n“I think everyone is thrilled for him, because over the last 12 months between a couple of injuries and operations he’s been out of action for a very long time. \n\n“He worked incredibly hard over the course of the three or four months. \n\n“I suppose there was a degree of pessimism about him for a while but certainly towards the end of August that all turned good and he’s been really flying and in great form since then. \n\n“And I think it would be great to see him get some game-time at the weekend.” \n\nJohnny Sexton and Simon Zebo suffered cramp in Ireland’s 21-13 defeat to England at Twickenham on September 5 but recovered without any issues. \n\nIreland head coach Joe Schmidt’s decision to include Healy in his final World Cup 31 has now been vindicated, even though the Leinster prop was not fully fit when selected. \n\nHealy’s presence will provide a clear advantage for Ireland in their target of reaching a first-ever World Cup semi-final. \n\nHooker Rory Best hailed 27-year-old Healy’s return as handing boss Schmidt’s squad a sizeable lift, off the back of consecutive warm-up defeats to Wales and England. \n\n“He’s a world-class player and he’s made an unbelievable recovery,” said Best. \n\n“But we know that about him, he has a tendency to come back really quickly and just to have that capability within your squad. \n\n“We’re very lucky to have Jack McGrath and Cian who are both fantastic looseheads, and you saw Jack really coming to the fore in the last Six Nations. \n\n“That’s put pressure on Cian and you can see the way he’s responded, and the way he’s come back this summer, he’s hungrier than ever to come back in and to try to get that starting spot back. \n\n“And he will be desperate to establish himself again as the world-class player that he is.”

0079_f8dc32f3-4ddf-427c-9691-c52eaa79e7fc	PR Newswire \n \nPERRIS, Calif., Sept. 29, 2015 \n   \nPERRIS, Calif. , Sept. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The County of Riverside is powering progress through renewable energy, flipping the switch on its first facility to be powered by the sun as part of the largest countywide conversion to solar ever launched in the U.S. Through a collaborative partnership with OpTerra Energy Services, the County celebrated the ongoing implementation of 12MW of solar across 10 sites, starting with the energization of the Perris Sheriff Station today. \n \nLet the Sun Shine \nWith almost 300 days of Southern California sunshine a year, Riverside County was eager to take advantage of their prime real estate for renewable power. The 12MW solar program will generate 18.6 million kWh of clean, renewable energy annually. The implementation of solar photovoltaic arrays will power and enhance the energy portfolio of 10 critical facilities tied to community services – including two sheriff stations, an animal shelter, and even the County health center. \n\nRiverside County's historic solar program is part of a broader effort to continue fostering a more sustainable region, focused on ongoing fiscal stewardship and community engagement across the County. The program will have far-reaching impacts across County cities from San Jacinto , Jurupa Valley, Palm Desert , Temecula , Moreno Valley , and Perris . Residents will benefit from the County's ownership of these new assets, with the program expected to generate approximately $200 million in taxpayer savings over the next 30 years. \n\nAccolades for Ownership \nDuring Tuesday's flip the switch celebration, local leaders recognized the County Board of Supervisors' leadership in ensuring the long-term ownership of their new solar system. Requiring no public capital investment, the County's far-reaching solar footprint utilizes energy savings to pay for all site installations happening through the end of 2015. Additionally, the County took advantage of Southern California Edison's Bill Credit Transfer Program to use excess energy generated at solar project sites to reduce expenses at those County-owned facilities that pay the highest utility rates. \n\nBy purchasing their new solar infrastructure outright, the County will own the system and enable even greater long term fiscal benefits than those anticipated over the 30-year life of the program. \n\nPowering Progress \nThe solar installations will go beyond fiscal savings and provide significant impact on County goals tied to enhancing economic development and quality of life. Some of the many community-focused benefits being captured as program implementation happens this year include: \n Over 1,000 jobs to be created over the lifetime of the program, with 287 jobs created during construction  80% local labor used for the project  40% offset of the County's total energy consumption for its 26 facilities  385,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide offset over the lifetime of the project  \nFrom a comfort level, providing shaded canopies for County residents and employees over existing parking lots across county facilities is a major win for the County as well. Protecting cars from the scorching sun in one of the hottest climates in the country is no small footnote – this benefit was especially pronounced at the Perris Sheriff Station where temperatures inside patrol vehicles can reach over 120 degrees. Shaded canopies keep employees comfortable, while helping prolong the useful life of vehicles by reducing heat related wear and tear. \n\nMore Success on the Horizon \nAs more County facilities' solar installations go online through the end of the year, the County is excited to promote the ongoing positive impact at future community events. The greenhouse gas emissions that will be reduced by this far-reaching project represent the equivalent to removing over 80,000 cars off the road – improving environmental and social outcomes for residents in myriad ways that go further than just fiscal savings. \n\nAbout the County of Riverside : With rivers, mountain peaks, deserts and fertile valleys, Riverside County offers diversity that few locations can match. More than two million people live in Riverside County and even more come to visit each year, taking advantage of affordable housing, nearby beaches, mountains, hiking and bike trails, the Wine Country near Temecula and resorts that offer oases in the desert. The county is working to diversify beyond the housing industry that has driven the region's economy for years. Transportation corridors – highways, airports and rail lines – support Southern California's shipping connection to Asia , a vital link for California and the rest of the nation. \n \nCalifornia's fourth largest county by population is expanding its economy, working to make Riverside County as business-friendly as possible and using health and recreations strategies to make the county a healthier place for residents. The county's commitment to sustainability combines with a rich cultural heritage and frontier history to make Riverside County a great place live, work or visit.

In fact, unbeknownst to him, that’s exactly what he did; the gesture means roughly the equivalent to the Aussies.\n\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama similarly shocked the British in 2009 when she placed her arm around the shoulders of Queen Elizabeth II.

In April, it unsuccessfully tried to return to the capital markets, seeking $15 million at $1 a share, but subsequently abandoned the raising. \n\nWhat KDL did not say was that those earnings forecasts were based on an assumption it could win a 30 per cent price rise for the yellow diamonds produced at its Ellendale mine from high-end jeweller Tiffany & Co. \n\nThe Tiffany negotiations ended unsuccessfully in May and KDL was forced to dramatically downgrade its earnings forecast. Its shares plunged 27¢, or 41.5 per cent, to 38¢. \n\nIt is understood ASIC is still investigating the affairs of Kimberley Diamonds, which closed its Ellendale diamond mine on June 30, leaving 100 workers unpaid and trade creditors owed millions more. \n\nToday, KDL shares were up 0.4 cents, or 6.56 per cent, to 6.5 cents shortly before the close of trade.

0085_3a21b875-9c4a-429e-bf45-0a772dd19cc9	"Sept. 14--Two former technology company executives were arrested last week on market manipulation and accounting fraud charges that appear connected to a former Charlotte hedge fund manager already serving time in federal prison. \n \nThe indictment unsealed in Manhattan outlines the role of an unnamed, unindicted hedge fund manager in North Carolina that fits the description of Stephen Maiden, who was sentenced in February to seven years in prison for an investment scheme that cost investors at least $8.9 million. \n \nThe indictment could bolster a civil suit that more than two dozen individuals, mostly in the Carolinas, filed in 2014 against Maiden and his former hedge fund administrator, SS&C Technologies . That case is currently moving forward in N.C. Business Court. \n \nIn last week's indictment in New York, a federal grand jury charged Kaleil Isaza Tuzman, the former chairman and CEO of KIT Digital, with market manipulation and accounting fraud. The company's former chief financial officer, Robin Smyth, was charged with accounting fraud. \n \nKIT Digital, a once publicly traded online video technology company, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2013 after acknowledging accounting errors and irregularities. The company, based in New York, has since emerged from bankruptcy under the name Piksel. \n \nTuzman and Smith no longer work for the company. Tuzman gained attention in 2001 when the former Goldman Sachs banker was featured in a documentary called ""Startup.com"" about his company govWorks, which became a casualty of the dot-com bubble. \n \nTuzman was arrested in Colombia and Smith in Australia, the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan said. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also filed civil charges last week against the pair. \n \nN.C. Business Court suit \n \nThe 2014 suit filed by investors against Maiden and SS&C Technologies previously alleged that Maiden had ties to Tuzman, saying they started doing business together in 2008. That suit says Maiden's involvement with Tuzman and two other individuals led to the demise of his fund. \n \nMaiden, Tuzman and the others ""came together for the purpose of using their web of companies to engage in self-dealing for their personal benefit,"" the suit alleges. \n \n[READ MORE: Bilked investors file suit against Maiden] \n \nGary Mauney, the Charlotte attorney representing the investors in the civil suit, said the context in the indictment indicates Maiden is the hedge fund manager listed as ""co-conspirator #1."" \n \n""The allegations of the complaint and the allegations in the indictment more or less read the same way in terms of some of the underlying transactions going on at the hedge fund,"" Mauney said. ""Certainly the matters that are laid out in the indictment will be part of the discovery in our case, which is ongoing."" \n \nThe U.S. Attorney's Office, the SEC and Maiden's attorney, Rick Glaser, declined to comment. \n \nThe indictment alleges that between December 2008 and September 2011, Tuzman and the hedge fund manager engaged in a scheme to artificially inflate the share price and trading volume for KIT Digital's stock. \n \nThe hedge fund manager, at Tuzman's behest, purchased and sold shares of KIT Digital to create the ""illusion"" of greater trading volume, the indictment alleges. Tuzman invested in the hedge fund and directed KIT Digital to invest in the fund without disclosing this to the public, according to court documents. \n \nThe civil suit in N.C. Business Court also describes an arrangement in which Maiden agreed to invest in KIT Digital shares ""to artificially increase the volume of trading"" and to ""increase the value of"" KIT Digital shares. Maiden, in return, received a ""secret payment"" for making the investments that he did not disclose to investors, the suit says. \n \nFriend, classmates lost money \n \nMaiden, now 42, launched the Maiden Capital Opportunity Fund in 2006 with investments from individuals in Charlotte and elsewhere, according to federal court documents. Hedge funds are loosely regulated investments for the wealthy. \n \nBy February 2009, Maiden had lost a substantial amount of investor funds in a series of failed investments, including in an unnamed ""illiquid microcap company,"" according to court documents. But to keep investors from pulling their money, he began sending out false statements showing that the fund was doing well and making money, court documents allege. By July 2012, Maiden Capital was insolvent. \n \nMaiden's scheme lost money for friends, former business school classmates, neighbors and even groomsmen from his wedding, according to the civil complaint in N.C. Business Court. \n \n[READ MORE: Maiden sentenced to 7 years] \n \nWhen Maiden was sentenced in February, U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad and prosecutors acknowledged Maiden had cooperated with an ongoing investigation, including meeting with authorities in New York. Maiden is serving his prison time at a medium-security federal facility in Cumberland, Md. \n \nThe investor suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages from Maiden and SS&C Technologies. The suit alleges SS&C papered over ""accounting infirmities"" at the fund and made a choice to stop ""documenting and verifying"" the fund's assets. \n \nLawyers representing SS&C did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n \nRick Rothacker: 704-358-5170, @rickrothacker"

It’s called the #BornAndMade campaign, and it’s just as it reads: it’s purpose is to show women that they were born and made beautiful , according to Yahoo! News. \n\nUsing the hashtag #BornAndMade, the campaign asks Instagram users to share images of themselves with their name, where they were born and a personality trait they’re “made with.” Users are also asked to complete the phrase “I am ___’s daughter,” which actually ties back to the company’s beginnings. \n\n""When I needed to come up with a name for our company I decided to come up with a list of things that I was and a list of things I wanted to become ,” founder Lisa Price said on Carol’s Daughter’s Facebook page. “I figured I would affirm something wonderful about myself or call into existence something yet to happen to me. So amongst the things that I was and am was Carol's daughter, I was also Robert's daughter, and at the time Hank's secretary and Gordon's girlfriend. I wanted to become Gordon's wife so I didn't want to affirm the girlfriend position so I picked ‘Carol's daughter.’ It was the one that felt the best, it was the one that made me smile, and that's who I am."" \n\nUsers can create their own image on the campaign’s website here . \n\nBut this isn’t the only campaign in recent months that has promoted positive messages about female body image. My colleague Kelsey Dallas reported in May about Dove’s #ChooseBeautiful campaign , which aimed to show that women, even when they’re considered “average” or “normal,” should still be considered beautiful. \n\nBut while Dove’s campaign referred to beauty as a choice, Carol’s Daughter’s message focuses more on how people are born with what makes them beautiful."

0090_0e679a7d-0576-4370-801b-90855d7aadf2	As Rep. Richard　Corcoran　was unanimously designated the next speaker of the Florida House Wednesday, he lived up to his promise to call for controversial reforms aimed at “cleaning up our own house” and policies such as universal school vouchers. \n\n“The enemy is not the special interests. The enemy is not the press. The enemy is not any of that stuff,” Corcoran, R-Land O’Lakes, told the Republican-controlled chamber. “The enemy has always been and will always be us.” \n\nHe laid out what he said is the truth about elected office in Tallahassee: politicians who campaign on one thing and “do another thing once elected;” elected officials who start seeking higher office as soon as they are sworn in; others who use their office to seek well-paying jobs “which we would never have gotten but for our service;” and others who “pander” to the press, avoid tough decisions and cave “to the special interests.” \n\n“When the political process is more accountable to the people, then, and only then, can we really begin to positively transform the lives of the people in our state,” he said. \n\nHe then ticked off a list of reforms that he said would ideally be changed in law but which he will first pursue by rule: \n\n▪  Create more transparency in government by requiring every lobbyist “to disclose which bills, which amendments and which appropriations they are trying to influence.” \n\n▪  Ban elected officials from taking jobs in government for six years after they leave office to “end the practice of legislators padding their pensions.” \n\n▪  Prohibit legislators from being able to take a job with any company or group that receives any funding from the state to “build an absolute firewall between our private lives and the influence of special interests.” \n\n▪  And close the “revolving door between the Legislature and the lobbying corps” by passing a constitutional amendment that bans legislators from lobbying for six years after they leave office. Corcoran has planned his slate of proposed reforms for years, working with the 28 fellow Republicans who were elected in 2010 with him and drafting them in a document he calls “The Manifesto.” \n\nAs he spoke, he was greeted with both polite applause and standing ovations from his GOP brethren, even though many of his reforms seemed targeted at them. \n\nIn the front row was a lineup of former House speakers — Democrat Lee Moffitt, Republicans Tom Feeney, Larry Cretul and Will Weatherford. All but Weatherford have registered to lobby the Legislature before the six-year window Corcoran seeks. \n\nWhile Corcoran made no mention of his “manifesto,” he explained that the changes must go beyond process and focus on broad reforms — in the education system, the justice system, and the judiciary. \n\nCorcoran stopped short of calling for universal education vouchers but called for lawmakers to “fully fund the right of all parents to choose what school best meets their child’s needs — regardless of whether it’s public or private, religious or secular, or home school or virtual school.” \n\nTaking aim at the Florida Supreme Court, which has ruled that offering every parent education vouchers violates the constitution, Corcoran called for 12-year term limits for all judges. \n\n He called for criminal justice “metrics” that show which criminals are getting the harshest and longest sentences, and he called for safeguards “to guarantee that justice in this state is never governed by the color of a person’s skin or the size of their wallet.” \n\nAnd Corcoran, who has spent his four years in office opposing Medicaid expansion and Obamacare, derided the “two-tiered health care system” and the state system that protects hospital profits at the expense of the poor. \n\n“It’s time people realized that conservatives aren’t against health care for poor people, we’re against giving them poorly run government health care,” he said, as his House members applauded but many Senate Republicans — notably Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando — remained seated. \n\nFinally, he called on his colleagues to “serve a purpose greater than ourselves” and “sacrifice our own interests” telling the story of Jack Mashburn, a distant relative of his wife’s, who in 1952 as a 22-year-old legislator changed the law that banned blacks from the beach only to be told by the racist leaders of his Panama City town that he’d be voted out of office. \n\n“Either you hear that story as a cautionary tale, or you hear it how I hear it — as a story of a person who put principle over politics,” he said. “…We can stand and fight, regardless of the cost, regardless of the consequences, regardless of the opposition.” \n\n Both friends and rivals commended Corcoran for his call to action, but many also doubted he would succeed. \n\nRep. Janet Cruz, D-Tampa, who will be the House Democratic Leader in 2016. called Corcoran’s ideas “a very aggressive agenda.” But she opposes putting term limits on judges and, having worked in a public defender’s office, she has questions about whether it’s a good idea to ban lawmakers from accepting jobs in government. \n\nAnd on the same week Corcoran was urging independence from the special interests, the political committee he runs to re-elect Republicans was hosting nearly a dozen fundraisers in Tallahassee to collect checks from special interests and lobbyists. \n\n“I commend him for wanting to step outside the boundaries of Tallahassee and tackle the problem,” said Pasco County Tax Collector Mike Fasano, Corcoran’s friend of 30 years who spent 19 years in the Legislature and attended the speech. “But you can’t go up there and say we’re going to overhaul the influence of special interests and then five minutes later take a check from those same special interests. If he wants to lead, he has not start with himself and he has to start now.” \n\nCorcoran responded that he knows there will be cynics and doubters but he believes there are legislators who want to give it a try. “It’s confront the brutal facts, and the brutal fact is ... man is flawed and if left to their own devices, they’re going to try to seek their self-interest,’’ he said. \n\nMiami Herald staff writer Kristen M. Clark contributed to this report.

They want their freedom. We all love to flirt, it doesn’t mean you’re going to bring the person home or have a sleepover.” \n (Hello! Magazine/PA)  \nShe also spoke about her previous marriage of 21 years to art director Ed Thrasher and her struggle to live her dream of being an actress. \n \n“I don’t like the word abusive because he was just living the life he knew how to live,” she says. \n \n“He was a creative guy and part of his dream was that he wanted to be a cowboy and run a ranch with horses, so when the children were little, we moved out here (to the house they designed and built together) and he had his horses and chickens. \n \n“Then when I announced I wanted to live my dream, the answer was, ‘No. You’ll become an actor when the children are in college.’ I thought, ‘My God, we’re living his dream, but what about mine?’ Of course, women stayed at home and raised their children – that was the way it was – but I was like, ‘Is that all there is?’.” \n (Hello! Magazine/PA) \nShe says landing the role of Sue Ellen Ewing in Dallas “opened so many doors, philosophies and ideas”. \n \n“All of us – Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, myself – were unemployed actors who happened to get a job and that job was Dallas. We had no idea it was going to be successful, so we were like, ‘Oh, here we are, trying the best we can’.” \n \nHer co-star, Hagman, famous for playing JR Ewing, died in November 2012. \n \n“We laughed every day,” she said. “Every day was different and funny. He was a born entertainer. There was just magic that happened between us. You know when you meet someone and feel like you’ve known them forever? That’s what it was like.” \n   \n Share article  \n   \nRead the full article in Hello! out now.
0092_6ef64365-9955-4493-9ea1-f5a50732c82a	THIRTY YEARS ago former farmer and publican David Robinson started an event that began behind the village pub where he was landlord. \n\nWhen it takes place again next weekend it will be spread across 85 acres, will include everything from steam rollers to fairground organs, traction engines, vintage tractors, cars and motorcycles and will see an attendance of over 7,000 across its two days. \n\nThe Hunton Steam Gathering has become a major part of the autumn show calendar between Bedale and Leyburn but David didn’t envision what it has become. It was a combination of his love of machines and particularly vintage tractors, a move back to the village where he was born and a meeting with the then chairman of the parish council that set the wheels in motion.\n\n“My wife Pauline and I had bought a small farm at Exelby just south of Bedale in 1976 where we had some Jersey cows providing milk for local people to come and collect, a herd of Large White X Landrace sows that at their peak reached 40 and a flock of sheep, but by 1984 we had decided that lambing sheep in snowstorms was enough for us and that we’d be better off inside in the winter months. We sold up and bought the pub in Hunton that was then called The Oddfellows Arms, which we renamed The Countryman’s Inn.\n\n“There’d been a piece of land donated to the parish council to make a children’s play area and Mrs Edie Todd, the parish council chairman, spoke with me about the need to raise money for equipment such as swings and slides. \n\n“I rang around trying to find out how much everything would cost and she nearly fainted when I told her the figure would be something like £5,000. I think she thought it was a nonstarter but I said that I’d see what I could do with my contacts on the vintage machinery side and that maybe we could hold an open day and raise some money.\n\n“Right from the 1960s I’d had vintage tractors and I’d brought my collection of them with me to the pub. I spoke with a few friends and we ended up with about 25 exhibits that first year in 1985. We had tractors, vintage cars and stationary engines. I also gathered up some people who made walking sticks plus a Morris dancing group. Our total cost for putting on that event in the first year was £108 and we made £1,000 profit, which meant that work could start on the play area.”\n\nThe Gathering has since raised thousands of pounds every year for other village needs such as a footbridge over the beck and has given to many charities. It moved to a larger location 15 years ago on the edge of the village.\n\n“As the show grew we borrowed lots of other little fields behind the pub and one of the fascinations people had was that we had different sections in separate walled fields. Eventually we had to move and we’re now grateful to Mr and Mrs Worsdale and Messrs Chapman who both allow us to use their farmland for the exhibits and the ploughing match that we started in 2007.”\n\nDavid and Pauline retired from The Countryman’s Inn in 2001 and now live in the nearby village of Great Fencote David’s passion for vintage machinery remains as firm as ever.\n\n“I’ve always been around machinery. My father Bill was a mechanic who became a haulage contractor and then bought a farm in North Cowton in 1957. \n\n“I was a wagon driver, delivering animal feed for Teesside Farmers in Darlington that became Farmway and then moved on to plant hire. I then bought my own wagon. \n\n“The first vintage tractor I ever bought was an Allis Chalmers Model B.

In every change He faithful will remain.” (Be Still My Soul from the Song Book of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints (LDS) page # 124) \n \nAs I sang those four lines at the opening of Sacrament meeting last Sunday, I was brought to tears and could not sing any further. I had been experiencing a lengthy struggle with the adversary over the last six months and that was the message I received from on high. \n \nThis message is for everyone as Satan will tempt us with the weaknesses we know best in ourselves. Whether it is the feeling of worthlessness, running faster than we are able or beating ourselves up that we are not the best at everything, (whatever it is), this physical manifestation of our own weaknesses will drag us down to depression; the kind of depression that is debilitating and scarring. \n \nSatan wants us to lose.  He wants us to be unsuccessful especially in sharing and helping others in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Whether a single person, single parent, married parent, grandparent or aunt or uncle, we are righteous spiritual beings all working towards the same finish: to raise righteous children, do the Lord’s work on earth and help others.   \n \nWe know that our God will not leave us without a rope to climb or an open window to escape, we are His children and He loves us. An LDS priesthood leader, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf tells us: “Our destiny is not determined by the number of times we stumble but by the number of times we rise up, dust ourselves off, and move forward.” \n \nBy the same token we are given weaknesses to be humbled and turn these same weaknesses to strengths. We read from the ancient prophet Ether who wrote: (Ether 12: 27-28) \n \n“And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them. \n \nBehold, I will show unto the Gentiles their weakness, and I will show unto them that faith, hope and charity bringeth unto me—the fountain of all righteousness.” How can we forget these beautiful messages? When we are in the midst of our weaknesses or struggles, the task at hand can be so difficult that we forget the love of our Heavenly Father. We forget our purpose and how to fight back against Satan. We forget that we are strong and should not get sucked into a pity party for ourselves which leaves us depressed and useless. \n To read more of Valerie’s articles, click here.  \nTwo years ago a movie was released to the theater which used this catch phrase: “Remember who your enemy is.” This statement had a profound effect on both me and my friend who saw the movie. We talked about how this catch phrase can help us realize how the adversary can over take our purpose and happiness. If we could only remember who our enemy is the battle would soon be won.  We have the tools of our scriptures, prayer and encouragement of our religious leaders to keep us safe from the enemy. We have the “whole armor of God” which in Ephesians says “…may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.” (Ephesians 6:11) We have our families and good friends who love us and can remind us of our blessings and the importance of keeping the faith. Be still and know that God loves us and wants the best for us.
0094_9390fb7b-6b2a-400e-b2bc-7e00b2c4d40c	The Denver Broncos beat the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday, with Peyton Manning leading the team to a scoring drive in the final minutes. \nThe Denver Broncos prevailed over the AFC West rival Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday, winning 31-24. It was a rough game for Peyton Manning, throwing another pick-six and taking multiple hits at the hands of an aggressive Chiefs defense. But he ultimately led the team down to a game-tying drive in the final minutes and a timely fumble by the Chiefs was returned for a touchdown, avoiding overtime and giving them the win.\n\nIt was an ugly game from the onset. There were four sacks, seven penalties and no points in the first quarter of play alone. There was also a bad fumble from Kansas City running back Jamaal Charles after a long drive that would have likely ended in points for the Chiefs. It didn't get any prettier from there, as the Chiefs lost a fumble at the beginning of the second quarter, giving Denver the ball in Kansas City territory.\n\nBut offenses didn't really prevail in this one, and after a successful fourth-and-1 was converted and then called back due to a timeout before the snap, the Broncos failed to convert and the Chiefs took over again.\n\nPoints weren't on the board until Denver shot themselves in the foot multiple times on defense. They were called for a pair of unnecessary roughness penalties, which advanced the Chiefs a total of 30 yards. That opened the door for Charles to take one 34 yards to the house for the first points of the game.\n\nThe scoring was rapid from there, with Kansas City putting up another touchdown after a Manning interception, and they seemed to have all the momentum before Manning threw a couple of touchdown passes in the span of a couple minutes to tie the game heading into the second half. Neither scored again until the Chiefs put together a scoring drive with under three minutes to go in the game. The Broncos followed it up with a touchdown of their own with under a minute to go.\n\nFrom there, the Chiefs had that costly fumble, which was returned for a touchdown, and they were unable to do anything with the remaining 27 seconds on the clock.\n\nManning had a pretty significant career milestone on Thursday, reaching 70,000 career passing yards. He needed just 134 on the day to reach the market, and he got that and then some. Manning finished completing 26 of 45 passes for 256 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.\n\nDenver only managed 61 yards on the ground, with Ronnie Hillman putting up 34 of them. Jamaal Charles led the way for Kansas City with 125 yards and a touchdown, but he also had that fumble. Alex Smith completed 16 of 25 passes for 191 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions.\n3 things we learned from Thursday's game\nThese pass rushers are pretty good\n\nJust in case you weren't aware, there were some pretty good pass rushers on Thursday. DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller were obviously the headline for Denver, and Justin Houston provided the pass-rushing oomph for the Chiefs. It was a bad game for quarterbacks, especially in the first half. Manning was under assault for much of the game and had to throw balls quicker than he'd have liked, while Smith didn't have much more luck himself. Both teams logged two sacks in the first half, with Denver adding another four quarterback hits and Kansas City adding three.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nThat kind of thing was pretty much happening all night long.\nManning is still struggling\n\nManning didn't have a great game in his debut against the Baltimore Ravens, throwing for just 175 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. That pick also was returned for a touchdown. On Thursday, he didn't look great from the onset, and then this happened:\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe pressure was in Manning's face, and he had to throw that ball well before he wanted to and the timing with his receiver just wasn't there. That was Marcus Peters securing the interception and the touchdown. Manning did find his groove and did eventually put points on the board for Denver, but it was another rough start for a player who can't have a lot left in the tank.\nSometimes your first instinct is the right one\n\nAt the beginning of the second quarter, the Broncos forced a fumble on De'Anthony Thomas, giving Denver the ball in Kansas City territory. They didn't get the first down after a handful of plays, and found themselves in a fourth-and-1 situation. It's unclear if Denver head coach Gary Kubiak second-guessed himself or what, but Denver ran a play, a run to CJ Anderson that successfully picked up the first down, keeping the drive alive. Look at it here:\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nBut the play was called back because the Broncos took a timeout before the beginning of the play, and the whistles came in late. So it went back to fourth-and-1, the Broncos tried another run to the other direction and this one wasn't even close to being converted. They turned the ball over to the Chiefs, who went on to put the first points of the game on the board on the ensuing drive.

0097_f9d4ece1-7e7a-4937-b200-6b46be42b80c	The LAPD is awaiting word on whether federal money will help fund body-worn cameras for officers, after the American Civil Liberties Union asked the Department of Justice to halt funding this month because videos will largely be kept from the public. \n \nCurrent allocation plans seek federal funds for about 10 percent of the camera purchases. Has Chief Charlie Beck contacted the DOJ the challenge the ACLU's position?   \n \nPlus, after a violent summer in South L.A., the homicide rate is up about seven percent in Los Angeles. How is the LAPD responding to residents' fears? And a scam alert from LAPD warns of phone calls claiming a family member is being held hostage for ransom. The calls are originating from Mexico. \n \nWe'll have more details on that and other crime and safety developments. \n Interview Highlights  \nLet’s talk about body cameras because LAPD rolling them out, you got them in the Valley, with other areas to come. But the ACLU has asked the Feds not to give any more money toward the department’s body cameras because you’re not making the footage available immediately in officer-involved shootings. Your response to tht? \n  \nWell, the ACLU is  welcome to offer whatever recommendations they want to whoever they want, but I don’t agree with them, I don’t think the federal government will agree with them either. Body cameras, and I’m wearing one right now as we talk and you can see it, are an evidence-collection tool, just like detectives are, just like the coroner’s investigation is, just like many many pieces of an investigation. We don’t release investigations piecemeal. Body camera footage is available for review by the district attorney, by the city attorney, by a civil court, by a criminal court, and in cases of uses of force that rise to the appropriate level, by the civilian police commission. So there are multiple levels of review, and to merely put video into the public without further investigatory information I think is inapprpriate. \n  \nOf course, the concern is that the department is going to release the video when it suits its interests, not so quick to do so when it makes the department the gatekeeper. How do you respond to that concern? \n  \nI respond to it by looking at my track record. I’ve been Chief for five years now. We’ve had in-car video for that whole time, and I haven’t released that video when it supports my position or when it is detrimental to my position or to the department. I use it as part of the investigation; it is not something I use to form public opinion. It’s an investigative tool. That is not to say that I would never release video. If the state of the city depends on it, then that would weigh heavily on my decision. But in the day-to-day incidents of policing. One of the things I like to remind folks is that when you call the Los Angeles Police Department, it’s not on your best day. It never is. We go to your house. There may have been a domestic incident. You may have been the victim of a crime. It could be any number of circumstances. None of which you want put in the public domain. At least, all of the victims I’ve ever talked to. And so we want to be very circumspect, we want to be the guardians of the public trust. When people interact with the police, I think they have a right to some privacy in that ondition. \n  \nI wanted to ask you about the rollout of the body cameras and whether you’ve had glitches with them so far. I know there was the pilot run of them, but now with more officers having them, how’s it going \n  \nSo far it’s gone very well. Obviously it’s a learned, physical skill. It’s just like taking your seatbelt off, or any other thing you learn by repetition. The activation of the body camera, the deactivation of the body camera. Learning the appropriate times. Remembering to do it under stressful circumstances. All of that has to become muscle memory to the officer. So they’re working on that, and we’re working on some certain other minor things. But nothing of anyimport. \n  \nI was talking with an officer who was engaged in a pursuit, caught a suspect, and he forgot to turn on his camera before he took off. So he got sent for retraining. Very frustrating for him, just saying, “It’s yet another thing we got to remember when we’re looking out for our safety, trying to catch someone, make sure the camera’s on.” Are you seeing as they’re getting used to doing this very many instances where they simply forget to turn on thecamera? \n  \nWell it happens. We forget a number of things; sometimes people forget to put the car in park, under stressful circumstances. They try to get out without taking their seatbelt off. They leave some of their equipment in the car. Human beings, and you know, we’re all human beings, have a lot of emotion and a lot of adrenaline running through their systems in stressful circumstances. And sometimes it can be hard to cognitively remember to do things. That’s why it has to be muscle memory, that’s why it’s so important to do it daily, to remember it, to do it in a way that’s consistent so that it becomes part of your day-to-day actions. So as we see that happen, we will see it being less and less of an issue. But it’s always going to happen because in those circumstances in where we’re the most interested in what the body camera collects, those are the most stressful cicumstances. \n  \nWell and you know there are going to be times, as we said before, it’s going to glitch because technology is not foolproof. There’s going to be times officers truly forget to turn it on, not just that they’re trying to  avoid being seen doing something. It’s always going to raise the suspicion that the officer or the department did something to keep it from being recoded. \n  \nWell I think that’s why it’s important to have the discussion we’re having now. To recognize that, 1) it is not the totality of the evidence. To be perfectly frank, the autopsy results, the ballistic results, the forensic results, the trace evidence results, often paint a much more concretely prosecutable or understandable picture than a body camera does because they are science where the body camera is going to capture what it captures. Like I say, it’s like the young kids watching a baseball game through a knothole; you only see what you see. And the body camera doesn’t collect everything. But it’s a great evidence collection tool, it will add to our ability to analyze incidents. I’m excited about it, I think it’s going to be something that is a game changerin policing.  \n  Guest:  \nCharlie Beck , Chief, Los Angeles Police Department
0098_b01e74d0-de83-4be0-9215-bef4e665e7ba	To the editor — For decades the federal government has been dipping into our Social Security funds for purposes other than what they were earmarked. President Obama transferred $716 billion of Medicare funds to Obamacare. As U.S. citizens, the children of illegal immigrants (our fastest growing and poorest population) have access to our resources. But it is our senior citizens being blamed for these programs’ instability and paying the consequences. \n \nTaxpayers are paying for the subsidies and child development for the poor and paying higher cost for health care to cover those insured through the Affordable Care Act. \n \nWhile state government is trying to shrink classroom size, schools are “struggling to education an increasing number of children who don’t speak much — or any — English,” according a Seattle Times article published in the Aug. 11 Yakima Herald-Republic. I also reference a photo on Page 1B that day: “Dance in Wapato like they do in Mexico.” Is this Americans’ resources at work? \n\nGovernment is allowing the poor (who have not had to make any sacrifices of their own) to squander our resources as a means to increase the size of their poor families. How long can America sustain them?
0099_94d91a1f-ab62-4643-8be0-9578a0138275	Sure, it’s an additional gigabyte of RAM and Bluetooth 4.2 however these features don’t lead to any existence-altering experience. The brand new software methods will quickly trickle lower towards the older Universe S6 and S6 Edge concerning can not be any sort of new hardware they need. This raises the advantage screen, that has grown in dimensions but nonetheless has limited utility. Additionally, there are the truth that Samsung has cast off the IR blaster for whatever reason, that is a shame as it is an opportune feature to possess. \n \nCut to the current and we’ve two new inclusions in the flagship Universe series – the Universe S6 Edge+ and also the Universe Note 5. Both stick to the same design language the S6 family set, also it appears as if Samsung will iterate about this formula for some time. Unlike the Universe Note Edge (Review), the Universe S6 Edge+ isn’t a companion towards the Universe Note 5 and does not have the special features such as the S Pen. Today, we’ll talk about the Universe S6 Edge+, which, initially, seems to become only a bigger Universe S6 Edge. The same is true it justify the (approximate) Rs 9000 premium over its more compact brother or sister? Let us discover. \n \n\n \nVerdict \nWe have old that Samsung did an admirable job using the Universe S6 Edge, and also the same is true for that S6 Edge+. The hardware and software updates result in the phone a little more future-proof however that comes in a rather steep cost. The telephone is roughly Rs 9000 more costly than its more compact brother or sister, so we don’t really see what extra value it provides to warrant this. So far as we are able to tell, there is not much – it’ll just appeal more to individuals who choose really large phones. \n \nOn top, we’ve the Nano-SIM tray along with a microphone for noise cancellation. What’s missing this is actually the infrared (IR) blaster that is present around the Universe S6 Edge. We are unsure why Samsung made the decision to depart it. At the base, there is the headset socket, Micro-USB port, and speaker grille. Flipping the unit over, we are able to begin to see the 16-megapixel camera, Brought expensive, and heart-rate sensor around the rear. You may also observe that our review unit were built with a ‘Made in India by Samsung’ inscription at the end. \n \n\n \nMicrosoft applications like Word, Stand out, Ms powerpoint, OneNote, Skype and OneDrive come pre-loaded. There is also 100GB of OneDrive cloud space for storage free for 2 years. Other software additions are available in your camera application, which we’ll enter into within the next section. \n \nLive Broadcast, another new addition, basically allows you livestream your phone’s screen contents to some YouTube funnel. You are able to set the stream as private or public, with respect to the content. However, video resolution here’s seriously restricted to WQVGA (426×240). \n \n\n \nAudio quality is excellent however the stock earphones neglect to highlight this. The wireless earbuds don’t offer much when it comes to ambient noise isolation because they don’t block your ears completely. The speaker is just moderately noisy, but Samsung’s notification tones come through noticeably enough. It is also too simple to hide the speaker grille when holding the telephone with you for gaming, which muffles audio further, though this really is much more of a pain than the usual serious drawback. \n \nFeel and look \nThe S6 Edge+ scores large within the appearance department because it looks simply stunning from the position. The Silver Titanium finish looks particularly good in daylight and it is certain to grab eyeballs. Samsung uses 7000-series aluminium for that chassis, much like Apple’s new apple iphone 6s and also the answers are superb. The telephone feels very sturdy and rigid but additionally delicate, meaning that you simply intuitively start to handle it with special care. That’s mainly because of the curved display, which leaves little room for grip. One for reds aftereffect of all of this metal and glass would be that the phone is extremely slippery and never simple to hold, for instance inside a crowded bus or train. \n \n\n \nPerformance \nThe Samsung Universe S6 Edge+ is definitely an absolute scorcher -when it comes to both performance and warmth generation. The telephone is blazing fast and did not skip a beat even if multitasking between heavy applications for example a game title and also the camera. The painful lag connected with TouchWiz has become a factor of history. The fingerprint scanner works a lot better than it did around the Universe S5 and a straightforward touch is what is needed to unlock the telephone. The phone runs taxing three dimensional games effortlessly however the consequence quite a bit of warmth. First, the region round the Samsung logo design around the back begins heating up, after which it propagates right side close to the energy button. We observed this after playing Angry Wild birds 2 for approximately a quarter-hour. Warmth only grew to become an problem for all of us when doing offers, and also the Universe S6 Edge+ only got warm at the best doing other things. \n \nHow big the display may be the only major physical alternation in the Universe S6 Edge+, in comparison towards the Universe S6 Edge. It sports a 5.7-inch Super Amoled screen having a 1440×2560 resolution, which will keep the pixel density well above 500ppi. The display is simply stunning, creating inky shades of black and saturated colours for viewing any kind of content. \n \n\n \nThe Universe S6 Edge+ isn’t a bad phone at all however it is not the wisest buy at its current cost of Rs 55,500. If you’ll want a curved-screen phone, we advise the Universe S6 Edge over its more recent brother or sister. The different options are the equivalent money and obtain the 64GB version with lots of change remaining for any wireless charging pier along with a wise cover. Should you just enjoy getting the most recent and finest toy to demonstrate, then your Universe Note 5 is really a more good choice. It’s less costly featuring an S Pen stylus, which allows much more helpful functions than this phone’s curved screen. \n \nThe amount rocker and energy button have good tactile feedback and are simple to achieve. The sensors, notification Brought, earpiece and 5-megapixel camera sit over the screen, as the home button using its integrated fingerprint scanner and also the capacitive Back and Recents buttons are put below it. We love to how Samsung has elevated the house button and used another texture to really make it simple to hit around the otherwise glossy panel. \n      \nThe big 3000mAh battery handled to continue for 14 hrs and seven minutes within our video loop test. This really is greater than exactly what the more compact Universe S6 Edge brother or sister handled, that is not surprisingly. We discovered that battery would last nearly one full day’s regular usage which involved doing offers, while using camera, making calls, and hearing music for moderate intervals. \n \n\n \nSearching at some amounts, we’ve got 67,401 points in AnTuTu and 24,060 points in 3DMark IceStorm Limitless. They are excellent scores and other alike as to the the Universe S6 Edge accomplished. Call quality was top-notch without any difficulties with dropped calls, and our unit easily locked onto Airtel’s 4G network where available. \n \nSamsung’s new design philosophy for flagship mobile phones has gotten only praise around the world. The days are gone of excessive chrome, plastic and fake leather – the brand new Samsung is developed and complicated. Roughly six several weeks ago, the organization released the Universe S6 and Universe S6 Edge, that have been such popular that Samsung had trouble maintaining. To satisfy the voracious appetite of customers, Samsung started manufacturing its two flagships in industrial facilities across twenty nations, and India was among the selected ones. \n \n\n \nThe Universe S6 Edge+ has excellent weight distribution because of which, the telephone doesn’t feel heavy. However, the bigger curved display and narrow sides get this to phone very challenging use with one hands- nearly impossible in lots of situations. There’s an excellent possibility of you shedding the telephone in the event you attempt to do this. Overall, ergonomics might have been better and it’ll take getting accustomed to holding this phone literally by its edges. \n \nSince the Universe S5, Samsung’s cameras happen to be key selling points because of its flagships, which is true despite the S6 Edge+. You launch your camera application rapidly by double-tapping the house button. You will find multiple effects to select from in addition to options for example Auto HDR and a number of scene modes. The brand new addition here’s Professional mode. This provides a column of toggle switches around the suitable for Whitened Balance, ISO, Shutter Speed, and concentrate. The alterations you are making could be observed in real-time so you are aware how one last picture will appear. Samsung also provides you with the choice to ‘Save as RAW’ in Professional mode, that is nice if you wish to have the ability to make professional edits afterwards. Actually, each RAW file is all about 30MB each so you could discover yourself drained of space rather rapidly. \n \nAround the software front, you receive Samsung’s TouchWiz interface on the top of Android Lollipop 5.1.1 out-of-the-box. The S6 Edge+ will get some subtle changes and couple of additional features in comparison to the brothers and sisters. The typical suite of Samsung applications like the Gear application, S Health, S Voice, SideSync, Universe Application store and S Planner are present. Additionally for this, we obtain the choice to make use of Tap&ampPay within the NFC menu, which is helpful once Samsung comes out its ‘Samsung Pay’ mobile payment system in India. \n \n\n \nThe S6 Edge+ is presently only accessible with 32GB of onboard storage without any microSD slot for expansion. This should not be considered a large problem for most of us, though should you intend on shooting lots of 4K videos (why is this so) or desire to carry your whole music library around, you’ll exhaust space rather rapidly. USB OTG is an excellent method of growing the onboard storage. \n \nThe Advantage screen sub-menu allows you personalize, well, the advantage. You are able to position a tab on each side from the screen and rapidly access any five contacts and applications of the selecting by swiping on it. Evening Clock is really a handy feature which teaches you time, alarm some time and battery level across the edge. Edge Lighting and individuals Edge works best for individuals contacts that you have put into the advantage screen. Information Stream allows you manage feeds along with other general notices from applications. You are able to download more feeds in the application store. Theme support is yet another fantastic aspect which allows you alter the whole appearance of your Universe S6 Edge+. \n \n(Click to determine full-size images) \n \n\n \n(Click to determine full-size images) \n \nCamera performance is excellent, regardless of lighting condition. Shirt is nicely saturated and the amount of detail is amazing, even if zoomed in. Optical image stabilisation (OIS) does an excellent job of eliminating undesirable shakes, and video quality is fairly stunning, even just in low-light. \n \nSpecifications and software \nThe specifications are virtually just like individuals from the Universe S6 (Review) and Universe S6 Edge (Review), which we have covered in-depth within their reviews. New updates include Bluetooth 4.2 (rather than 4.1) along with a bigger serving of RAM, that can bring the entire to 4GB. It’s difficult to inform when the additional RAM makes any immediate effect on performance once we did not notice any major distinction between this and also the S6 Edge with daily usage. However, as the application data develops and Android receives updates down the road, the extra gigabyte might end up being helpful. \n \nSamsung Universe S6 Edge+ in pictures \n \nThe post appeared first on News List Online .

""We have seen a whole series of initiatives that the government has taken on the ground but there is a long way to go,"" Naushad Forbes, president-designate of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said yesterday. \n \nDuring an interaction at Atlantic Council, a top American think-tank, Forbes, who is currently leading an industry delegation to the US, observed that more steps needs to be taken to make India an investment friendly destination.Referring to some of the recent announcements taken for Foreign Direct Investment in India, Forbes said there is a huge potential in manufacturing sector both from the growth perspective and inclusion perspective.""This is just starting down now,"" he said.Goods and Services Tax (GST), one of the key issues for economic reforms, he said, has been talked about for a long period of time. ""We have great confidence that it (GST) would pass in the next couple of months,"" Forbes said, adding that according to CII estimates, this would result in increase in India's GDP.CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said the seven per cent growth rate achieved last quarter could be impressive by international standards, but not by Indian standards. ""This is much below what we want to grow. We want to grow at 10 per cent. For this we want the manufacturing to grow 10-15 per cent,"" he said.The potential of India US trade, he argued, is huge.

0104_7030f935-cab4-48c6-a6a0-f09c61636d9e	Day 3 (Thurs) - not really a first, but something I dread doing.\nMaking a difficult phone call:  I hate making phone calls.  I have pushed tasks like this onto my husband for the past several years and I have embraced texting whole-heartedly because of my aversion to making talking on the phone.\nMy reasons are good:\n** I can't see the persons face I'm talking to and can't judge reactions.  (I need to be able to read a person).  Like, how do I know if they think something I've said is really stupid?\n** My ear gets really hot and sweaty on the phone - well, the iPhone - and I'm afraid it will combust.  I'm sure that's happened to somebody, somewhere.  Don't i phones cause ear cancer??  :/\n** I love procrastinating.  Ok, that one's a lie, but when a phone call is the task at hand, I am an excellent procrastinator.\n** Awkward silences.  This one is the worst.   Hello?  Are you still there?  Are you watching a movie?  Going to the bathroom?  Ugh!  I think someone needs to invent a sensor on your phone that will fill in the awkward silences with music or sound effects;  can I have a good drum roll please?\n    Okay, back to the story....  I needed to make some phone calls to the university where my daughter will be attending.  After going to a year of college, she decided to serve an 18 month mission for the LDS church and she will be returning home in time for winter semester.  She was able to defer scholarships, etc, but she needed my help to find housing, talk to her coach, and make sure her financial stuff is in order.  Great, that means I get to talk to several people I don't know and one track coach that I've only met a few times.\n   And so, I went to my desk with all her info in hand (which was no small task to get together), my computer and phone ready and  gathered courage.  And I just DID IT!  It took me a few sessions of an hour each, but I felt pretty dang proud of myself for doing it.  I even got some applause from my husband (who supports me in (nearly) everything I do) when he overheard me talking on the phone!  It really wasn't as hard as I'd built up in my mind, but I just haven't been able to like the phone much.  Even now.\n    Lesson learned?  Getting those unpleasant jobs done can be a cleansing experience.

Herald-Leader staff photo by Pablo Alcala. \n \nAt 48, Kim Davis is the right age to have been infused with  Rocky III  theme  Eye of the Tiger  as a go-to psych-up anthem. But members of Survivor, the band that wrote and recorded the 1982 hit, are none too happy that the song played Tuesday as the embattled Rowan County Clerk was released from jail, where she had been confined on a contempt of court charge . \n \n“I was very surprised and dismayed at the misuse of the song I co-wrote with Frankie Sullivan for Rocky III ,” Survivor co-founder and song co-writer Jim Peterik said in a statement to Billboard magazine . “The song has motivated thousands through the years to reach beyond their limits. Its use for the release of Kim Davis does not support my views or my politics. I have contacted my publishers to make sure this usage is stopped immediately.” \n \nSurvivor frontman Sullivan took to Facebook to say, “NO! We did not grant Kim Davis any rights to use ( The Eye Of The Tiger ). I would not grant her the rights to use Charmin!” \n \nTMZ reported the band is considering legal action . \n \nDavis has refused to issue marriage licenses since a United States Supreme Court ruling in June legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. She said issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples conflicted with her beliefs as an Apostolic Christian.  She was jailed on Thursday after refusing to comply with Federal Judge David Bunning’s order to issue marriage licenses or allow her staff to issue them. \n \nThe situation has garnered nationwide attention, and Tuesday, Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz both went to Grayson, where Davis was being held, to rally for her support. Huckabee was on stage with Davis when she was released, and Survivor’s iconic anthem played. \n \nIt is far from the first time bands have gotten in disputes with political figures over their music being played at rallies. Recently Neil Young and Donald Trump have been in a dispute over Republican presidential candidate Trump’s use of Young’s  Rockin’ in the Free World  at campaign events. \n \nClick here for more on the Kim Davis situation from Kentucky.com .
0106_b5b74b21-77c3-4511-905f-39bdb0b0f93b	"Carly Fiorina has a message for Donald Trump: Yes, ""look at this face."" \n \nThe former Hewlett-Packard CEO kicked off her speech Friday night to the National Federation of Republican Women in Phoenix by offering a clear rebuttal of Trump's recently quoted comments on her in which he criticized her looks. \n\n""Ladies, look at this face,"" Fiorina said, to strong applause. ""This is the face of a 61-year-old woman. I am proud of every year and every wrinkle."" \n\nFiorina didn't call out Trump by name on Friday night, but her remarks were tailored to the receptive, women-dominated crowd. \n\n""Look at all of your faces,"" Fiorina said, according to video posted online. ""The face of leadership. The face of leadership in our party, the party of women's suffrage. The face of leadership in your communities, in your businesses, in your places of work and worship. Ladies, note to Democrat Party: We are not a special interest group, we are the majority of the nation."" \n\nFiorina's comments were in light of remarks Trump made in a Rolling Stone profile published this week when he reacted to seeing her appear on TV. \n\n""Look at that face!"" Trump said. ""Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president."" \n\nHe has since explained the remarks by saying he was talking about Fiorina's persona, not her looks, and that he made comments about women ""as an entertainer."" \n\nThe only woman running in the GOP field, Fiorina has made an effort to speak to women to counter-balance Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and the Democrats' calls of a ""war on women"" by the Repubilcan Party. \n\nIn fact, Clinton was the only candidate Fiorina called out by name on Friday. \n\n""I have met more world leaders on the stage today than anyone running with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton, but I didn't do photo ops, I did business. And charity. And policy work,"" Fiorina said, saying a leader must understand and navigate the world. \n\nShe also noted that a leader must understand technology. \n\n""And no, Mrs. Clinton, you do not wipe a server with a towel,"" she said. \n\nFriday night, Fiorina delivered a speech full of her usual talking points but tailored to her audience. \n\nCalling out Democratic messaging, she said women care about a range of issues, just like men do. \n\n""I personally am so tired of hearing about women's issues. Every issue is a woman's issue,"" Fiorina said. \n\nBut she also drew anecdotes from her own biography, rising through the ranks of Hewlett-Packard and facing sexism along the way. She also recounted being asked on national television whether a woman in the Oval Office might be affected by her hormones. \n\n""So ladies, let's just think. Can we think of a single instance in which a man's judgment was clouded by his hormones?"" she quipped, to roaring applause. \n\nShe continued: ""I am not asking for your vote and your support because I am a woman. I am asking for your vote and your support because I am the most qualified candidate to win this job and to do this job."""

The journey is a benefit run that, once completed, could change the lives of up to 250 underprivileged youth \n     Caleb Galaraga     \nPublished 3:54 PM, September 04, 2015 \n \nUpdated 3:55 PM, Sep 04, 2015 \n      \n\n\nChristian minister Ferdie Capiling plans to run from Saranggani to Aparri. Photo courtesy of the author. \n \nMANILA, Philippines - Two thousand. Two hundred. Twenty. Forty-four. \n \nOn Saturday, September 5 at 3 AM in Maasim, Sarangani, a town in Mindanao lying at the southernmost tip of the country, these numbers will be top-of-mind to one man’s race, a run across the Philippines. \n \nPastor and ultra marathon runner Ferdie Cabiling embarks on what he describes as an “epic and raw adventure.” He will run 50 kilometers a day for 44 days, and while in the trek will celebrate his 50th birthday. \n \nThe title of his journey: RUN50. It starts at Sarangani and will end at Aparri, a total of 2,180 kilometers. Crossing the finish line is a must, but more importantly, the journey is a benefit run that, once completed, could change the lives of up to 250 underprivileged youth. \n \nInspired by a running priest \n \n“The idea of running around the corner in a new place is already a treat. But running around the country? It’s even more exhilarating,” the pastor shares in a blog post, Seven Reasons why #RunAcrossThePH. \n \nThe spark to do RUN50 came after reading the blog of another minister, a running priest named Father Amado “Picx” Picardal. \n \nAfter all, the pastor has the chops to do a long-haul run. He has completed 10 marathons that were organized by General Jovie Narcise. He’s also very passionate and vocal about the sport. Leaders and members of his home church, Victory Manila, already call him the running pastor. The soon-to-be 50-year-old minister is currently one of the church’s executive directors, where he oversees its 15 congregations in Metro Manila, attended by up to 75,000 people every week. \n \n“It’s a dream project that would benefit many. I’ve already trained and equipped him for it and he has the mental toughness to finish the race,” says his trainer, Tito Salazar. \n \nCabiling has been working with him for 3 years and has relied on him for encouragement, support and professional guidance. Thanks to Salazar’s coaching, the passionate runner has completed some daunting and challenging runs like the Bataan Death March 160K Run. \n \n“His legs are worth millions,” Salazar says, expressing full confidence that his client can complete his races. “Fifty kilometers a day for him is like a walk in the park,” the trainer adds. \n \n'I run for those who can’t' \n \nVictory is known in evangelical circles as a young and dynamic ministry. It has grown by leaps and bounds since its founding, thanks to a relentless focus on reaching students. Their mission is imbued in a catchphrase its active young members repeat like a mantra: “Change the campus. Change the world.” \n \nCabiling was one of the first members of the church, since the latter’s accidental founding in the mid-1980s by American missionary Steve Murrell. \n \n“I can’t clearly put a demarcation line on when,” he responds, asked when he became a full-time pastor. In 1984, while studying Civil Engineering at Adamson University, he first heard the gospel from a group of missionaries and committed to be part of what was then a daily worship service. It was during those times when he met Murrell, who would be his mentor in the faith. As a young evangelical, he discovered that he was more passionate in bridging people to God than building real bridges. \n \nOver the next 30 years, he will be mentoring young people who would turn out to be some of Victory’s major influencers. Case in point: Two men he shared the gospel to, both of whom were still teenagers when he was their Bible study leader, are now senior pastors of 2 large Victory congregations. \n \nDeveloping leadership skills and imparting the desire to live a life of integrity and excellence, while prioritizing the growth of one’s faith, is at the heart of Victory’s outreach. In 2007, members of the church leadership created the Real LIFE Foundation, with “the vision of seeing thousands of marginalized Filipino youth educated, gainfully employed and uplifting their communities.” \n \nRUN50 will raise a little over P2 million pesos for the organization, enough to support 250 scholars. \n \n“I will be raising P1,000.00 per kilometer. And since there are 2,180 kilometers from Maasim to Aparri, we will be raising almost P2 million pesos,” the running pastor shares. \n \nCabiling’s wife, Judy, initially teased her avid runner of a husband that his love for the sport is caused by a mid-life crisis, “She actually increased my insurance.” \n \n\n\n(R-L) Ferdie Cabiling, his wife Judy, daughter Elle and son John Phillip. Photo courtesy of the author \n \nBut similar to how Judy faithfully supported her husband’s calling, she has been all in to his every personal race. Their daughter Elle, who recently graduated from the University of the Philippines and is preparing to become a full-time minister herself, is heavily involved in the logistics of RUN50. Their 11-year-old son, John Phillip is a major inspiration for this race. “He can walk and tries to run sometimes to show off to daddy, but he does it by literally dragging his right leg which was affected by the inborn condition in the brain.” \n \nThe marathoner dedicates this coming race to John Phillip and others who are experiencing disabilities. “I run for those who can’t,” is a tagline the pastor uses on all his runs. \n \nFor God and the next generation \n \nCabiling is flying to Mindanao 48 hours before his race so he can pray for a church member in General Santos suffering from cancer. He won’t be running on Sundays, as he’ll be preaching in churches – as he had been doing for the past three decades. Praying for government leaders of cities and municipalities along the path of RUN50 is also in the plan.  \n \n“As a believer, I run for God’s glory and pleasure,” Cabiling writes in a blog post. He then refers to a quote by the famous Scottish athlete and missionary, Eric Liddell: “I believe God made me for a purpose and He also made me fast. When I run, I feel His pleasure.” \n \nCabiling has dedicated his life to inspiring the next generation to live a life for God. The chance to positively influence the lives of 250 Filipino students may be the greatest prize of the solo journey of a man filled with faith. \n \nIt wouldn’t be daring to suggest that it would be to God’s pleasure that he completes it. - Rappler.com \n \nTo know more on how you can support RU50, visit Pastor Ferdie Cabiling’s website here . \n \nCaleb Galaraga is a freelance writer based in Metro Manila.

The AL is the superior league by far and has been for more than a decade.\nSo far in 2015 through 7 September and including their All-star match triumph, AL teams are 151-124 or 54% wins against NL teams or right in line with the AL's record of dominance over the past dozen years.\nThis is the AL's 12th consecutive triumph in annual inter-league contests starting with 2004. The only positive sign for the NL is that the AL's 53% average (including All-Star and World Series matches) from 2010 on is below the 55.9% average from 2004 through 2009 and below the annual average winning record of 54.5% for the entire 2004-2015 period of AL dominance.\nThe AL has now won 16 of the last 19 all-star games to reach a decision and 21 of the last 27. \nToronto Blue Jays\nI have to declare a conflict of interest when Toronto faces a NL squad -- 10-7 so far. I and official Godiva toy boy and fiancé Archibald have a friendly wager. If the AL's winning % against the NL for the entire 2015 season betters the Blue Jays' record, dearest Archibald has to treat me like the Queen of Sheba for a day. Conversely, if the Blue Jays better the AL's mastery over the NL, I have to dress up and act like the Queen of Sheba paying court to King Solomon for a day. \nSo far, Arch and his beloved Blue Jays are 78-59. My prognostication of continued Lady G mastery over Archibald based on AL domination over the NL exceeding the Blue Jays' win percentage is in doubt with 2/13 of the season left. \nBlue Jays leading both leagues averaging 5.5 runs/match and now 12th best allowing 4.1 runs/match. If they keep up such a large run differential of +1.4/game, they will finish 1st in the AL East and make the playoffs for the 1st time since 1993. The only reason that they are only a 57% team so far is their 13-24 record in one-run games, which is almost entirely due to bad luck. \nBut, with minor-leaguers Pillar, Colabello, Thole and Goins in the line-up regularly, it's hard to believe that they can keep scoring 5 runs/match over the remainder of the season. So far, Colabello is hitting like an all-star rather than the career journeyman that he has been up to now and Pillar and Goins have both been impersonating major-leaguer hitters with Goins leading the AL in on-base % since 1 August. This is amazing for a player who was one of the worst hitters in baseball last year. Both Goins and Pillar are exceeding their minor-league numbers so far this year. I keep waiting for the true minor-league talent levels to emerge as the season wears on, but so far so good for the Jays.  \nThe Jays had uncanny good luck hitting with runners in scoring position over the first 11/13 of matches. My premise is that what looks like clutch hitting is just dumb luck. I expect to see the Jays' runs/match fall back to the pack over the rest of the year. \nJays 8-42 in matches when they score 3 runs or less and 70-17 when they have score more than 3. All teams have a split like that, but my guess is that the split is particularly extreme for the Jays and that over 1/3 of matches with 3 runs or fewer is unusually high for a team averaging 5.5 runs/match.\nI predict that the trade of declining, overpaid Reyes for declining 30-year-old Tulowitzki overpaid through 2020 will not help the Jays much this year and will hurt in future. That being predicted, I have to note that the Jays are 28-8 since Tulowitzki arrived. Tulowitzki is certainly better than Reyes, but not by that much. The 28-8 streak is good luck not related to Tulowitzki over a period when their starting pitchers were setting a team record of 20 straight matches allowing 3 or less earned runs. LaTroy Hawkins should also help in the bullpen. However, the three pitching prospects sent to Colorado will likely be worth more than Tulowitzki in future years. When the trade went down, I predicted that last-place Colorado would make play-offs before the Jays. I continue to believe that both Mets and Miami got the better of their trades with the Blue Jays after the 2012 season and that both have better prospects of making the playoffs before the Jays as a result. The sooner Jay General misManager Anthopoulos is gone, the better. Even after the Jays make the playoffs this year, I fear that they are more likely to lose 100 games than make the playoffs again over the next few years. However, I do recognize that the Jays and Anthopoulos are on the threshold of proving me wrong for this year. \nHiring Cleveland General Manager Mark Shapiro as new Blue Jay President is a good sign. Unlike Anthopoulos, Shapiro is a ""value-for-money"" operator.\nI view Anthopoulos as similar to a mutual fund manager who follows an active stock-picking strategy. An active stock-picker can lead the mutual fund annual tables due to good luck in any given year, but over the long haul a ""value indexer"" like Billy Beane in Oakland will continue to have a better record than whoever is running the Jays until Toronto brings in a quantitative analyst to run the team. Here's hoping that Shapiro gets a chance to hire his own people.  \nIf the Jays go 8-4 in matches started by David Price vs. 6-6 if they had put Aaron Sanchez back in the rotation, that could make the difference between finishing in or out of the playoffs. So far, Jays are 5-2 in matches started by Price and one of the losses was misManager Gibbons' fault. \nJays probably need to win just 9 or 36% of their remaining 25 games to make the playoffs. If they maintain their positive run differential, that should remain 1st in the AL East ahead of the Yankees easily as ESPN talk radio host Mike Greenberg and ESPN commentator Rick Sutcliffe predicted right after the Tulowitzki and Price trades. Jays are now on track to win 90 which should be good enough for 1st.\nSo far this year, Jays started 23-30, then went on a 14-2 streak followed by 13-19, then 28-7 or the best 35-game stretch in team history with 80% wins projecting to 130-32 over a full season. Let's see how well they do in the final stretch of the season with most matches on the road. So far, they are 0-1. I remain skeptical that they can close it out well enough to win a playoff round. Their ageing stars -- Bautista, Encarnacion, Martin, Tulowitzki, Dickey, Buerhle -- are vulnerable to fatigue and injuries as the season wears on. But, of course, so are the Yankees with Teixera, AFraud, Sabbathia and Beltran (and now it looks as if Texeira may be through for the year). \nBill James wrote a famous article showing that Detroit's 35-5 start in 1984 could not likely be a run of good luck by a mediocre team. Over 40 games, the chances of a mediocre team posting a 35-5 record are tiny. The same must be true for the Jays 28-7 streak this year. The 2015 Jays are right up there with the 1984 Tigers and the LA Dodgers 42-8 streak of a few years ago for the best hot streaks in MLB history. But, I am still skeptical. If I get time before the start of the 2016 season, I would like to look at 2015 ""batting average balls in play"" (BABIP) numbers for Goins, Pillar and other Jay hitters and the pitchers as well. Is it possible for an entire team to have an unusually lucky BABIP year on both sides of the ball?\nArchibald is so confident that this is the year for the Blue Jays that he has promised to end our long engagement and marry me outside the Skydome the day after the Blue Jays win the World Series. On 2nd thought, perhaps Archibald is not confident in his Blue Jays winning. I'm starting to think that he likes being engaged more than he wants to be married."
0110_3177add6-be44-4a0c-8d58-7d0ccb9c0320	Author: Chung-In Moon, Yonsei University \n \nOn the brink of a crisis that threatened to escalate into conflict, North and South Korea recently reached an agreement on 25 August to prevent further confrontation, resume official talks, hold reunions of separated families and promote civilian exchanges. This was a remarkable reversal in tensions. But the thaw is only the beginning of a precarious and long journey toward peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. As long as Pyongyang keeps its nuclear weapons program, it is virtually inconceivable that confidence-building and peaceful co-existence between the two Koreas can be achieved. \n \n\n \nSince March 2009, the North Korean nuclear issue has been stalled and the Six-Party Talks suspended. While North Korea has declared ‘no more talks with the US’, Washington is equally reluctant to engage with Pyongyang unless the hermit regime takes some concrete steps toward denuclearisation. Stuck between the two, China, South Korea and other the other Six-Party Talks members have become lethargic. Are there any ways out? \n \nThe recent Iranian nuclear deal could serve as a useful benchmark. As President Barack Obama claims, it was a victory of diplomacy over war. Several factors account for its success. Setting realistic goals was one of those factors. Against the conservative’s all-or-nothing approach of insisting on ‘no deal without a complete removal of nuclear programs’, the US admitted Iran’s right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, while banning its enrichment programs under a tight inspection regime. \n \nEqually crucial was setting the right priorities. Iran has been notorious for its sponsorship of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, interference in the domestic politics of neighbouring countries, undermining regional stability and human rights violations. But the nuclear issue was prioritised, with the anticipation that other issues would become easier to solve once the nuclear one was settled. The US also aptly limited sanctions, which was useful in bringing Iran to the negotiation table and making the current deal. Additional sanctions would have created a serious political backlash, which could have penalised moderates such as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani while empowering such hardliners as radical Islamic forces and the military. \n \nIran and North Korea are, of course, very different. Iran does not have nuclear weapons, while North Korea does. The permanent members of UN Security Council have all reached a consensus on the Iranian deal, but members of the Six-Party Talks have been divided over how to deal with the DPRK. Iran has taken a practical path to denuclearisation for economic gains, whereas North Korea is seeking the perilous nuclear path despite enormous economic costs incurred by sanctions. No matter how limited it may be, Iran has a pluralistic political system with regular competitive elections. North Korea, on the other hand, is an extremely monolithic political system without any free elections. \n \nFor all the differences, the Iranian model can still be applied to North Korea. Sanctions, pressure and military action are not viable alternatives . The US should forsake its ‘strategic patience’ policy and engage. Demonising North Korea will lead the US nowhere. As with Iran, the US should set more practical goals. Complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear weapons will take a long time. As Siegfried Hecker — a renowned US nuclear expert — has suggested, it would be wiser to seek a ‘halt and roll back’ option. Freezing current nuclear programs and rolling back to the level specified by the agreement reached on 13 February 2007 — whereby North Korea agreed to shut down and seal its major nuclear research facility, Yongbyon, and invite international monitoring — might be the most practical solution. \n \nNo matter how powerful the US is, it cannot achieve complete denuclearisation, opening and reform, human rights improvements and cyber security in North Korea simultaneously. There must be a reordering of priorities where utmost attention is given to the nuclear issue. The Iranian nuclear deal would have never materialised without personal commitments by top US Department of State officials like John Kerry, William Burns, Wendy Sherman and President Obama himself. In a similar vein, high powered figures need to be appointed solely to deal with Pyongyang. \n \nIt is not easy for Obama to change his position on North Korea, particularly given his political schedule. Outside pressure seems necessary. Such pressure can come from South Korean President Park Geun-hye, who will be visiting Washington in October 2015. Using recent improved inter-Korean relations as leverage, Park can persuade Obama to engage with the North and to resume the Six-Party Talks. Such an approach is the only realistic one that can bring North Korea back to the negotiating table and foster the process of its denuclearisation . \n \nIt is ironic to note that learning from its failures in dealing with North Korea was vital to the United States’ success in dealing with Iran. Now it is time for the Obama administration to apply what it has learned from Iran to North Korea. \n \nChung-in Moon is a professor at the Department of Political Science, Yonsei University.

When we came out and got in the car we could see impressive lightning strikes to the west, accompanied by dark funnel clouds descending over the White Tank Mountains. When we got out on the road we could see that same strong storm activity to the north and to the east of us. And yet, we didn't have a single drop of rain touch our windshield. This year's monsoon season has been as strange as Bruce Jenner's wardrobe. A few weeks ago, just to the west of us, the little town of Wickenburg had a ""hundred year flood""...and we didn't get a drop of rain over our way. Last week was the same. As we were bone dry in Sun City and Surprise, folks over in Scottsdale were drowning, their cars doing the dog paddle down the East 101 freeway. On Friday I drove over to Safeway. The wind was blowing forcefully, shingles on roofs were flying about like frisbees, but we didn't get enough rain to fill a shot glass! So, as we drove home, I looked about, west, north, south and east, and torrential rains and gale force winds were having a party up in Cave Creek, over in Scottsdale, in Tempe....and we were driving along a highway in calm seas just a few miles from those storms! The next morning I opened up my morning paper and looked at pics of trees fallen in long impressive rows over on the East side. The electric company says 14,000 people are without power due to the storm bringing down power lines. And we are still sitting here high and dry! Amazing! Arizona's monsoon has now eclipsed the awe that we once felt about the weather when we lived in Hawaii. In Hawaii you could stand on one side of the street, the sun shining and not a drop of rain, and the other side of the street would be drenched in a downpour, an impressive stream of water flowing down the street gutters. But an Arizona storm is absolutely freaky....it'll level a house with a microburst, fill a whole neighborhood with a foot of water, and the other side of town will be sunny and dry and leaving one to say ""what storm?"" Monsoon season in Arizona ends every year around the 15th of September. We won't miss it. ""Monsoon, we hardly knew ye""."

He has played a leading role in the development of Sinn Fein's peace strategy and is a longstanding and loyal supporter, defender and advocate of the peace and political processes. \n\n""We look forward with confidence to his early release."" \n\nPolice have said the murder of Mr McGuigan was not sanctioned by the IRA. \n\nBut they said one of the major lines of inquiry is that members of the Provisional IRA were involved in the murder. \n\n\t\t\t \nIt has been alleged to have been carried out in retaliation for the murder of another former IRA prisoner, Gerard ""Jock"" Davison, at his home in the Markets area of Belfast in May. \n\nMr Storey was one of three men, aged 45, 58 and 59, who were arrested in Belfast this morning as part of the police investigation. \n\nIn 2005 former Ulster Unionist South Antrim MP David Burnside told the Commons: ""The Secretary of State knows the facts from his security information. He knows about Bobby Storey, head of intelligence, reporting to the army council."" \n\nSinn Fein president Gerry Adams also reacted to the arrest, describing Mr Storey as a valued member of the party leadership, a person of great integrity and someone he trusts. \n\n\t\t\t \n""He's been charged with nothing. I have grave concerns about how all of this current crisis has developed since the dreadful killing of Kevin McGuigan, and am mindful in recent times that two families, the Davison and McGuigan families, have both been grieved,"" Mr Adams said. \n\nThe Sinn Fein leader claimed the potential for a breakdown of the talks at Stormont House was more to do with ongoing competition for support between the Ulster Unionists and Democratic Unionists. \n\nMr Adams added: ""At this stage I don't want to go any further than saying I have grave concerns about how all this has developed, including the arrest of Bobby Storey."" \n\nSinn Fein said it was their understanding that DUP leader Peter Robinson had given Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers ""an ultimatum"" to suspend the Stormont institutions or the party's ministers would be withdrawn following the Storey arrest. \n\nSubsequently the DUP sought an adjournment of Assembly business. \n\n\t\t\t \nThe McGuigan arrests, made in north and west Belfast, take to 16 the number of people detained as part of the murder investigation to date. \n\nOne man has been charged with weapons offences. \n\nMr McGuigan, a 53-year-old father-of-nine, was gunned down outside his home at Comber Court in the Short Strand area of east Belfast last month. \n\nHe was suspected by some in the republican movement of involvement in the Davison murder. \n\nAlthough detectives said individual IRA members were involved in the shooting, they have said there is no evidence to suggest it was sanctioned at a senior level. \n\nPolice Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable George Hamilton has also said the IRA is not engaged in terrorism but instead is pursuing a peaceful, political republican agenda. \n\nThe political fallout from both murders has had major repercussions for the devolved Assembly, with crisis talks ongoing at Stormont in a bid to save the stumbling institutions. \n\n\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved."

0115_88b2e5e5-1b4b-4aa1-998c-940e70fef93e	 \nIt’s fitting that Roger Goodell’s biggest failure, the one that could well end up permanently lessening the considerable power he and NFL owners have traditionally held over the NFLPA, was born out of the stupidest scandal in the history of the NFL, and perhaps all of sports. This is precisely the kind of defeat that someone as impotent and hollow-headed as Goodell deserves. \n\nHe suspended Ray Rice just two games after Rice knocked his fianceé out in an elevator, then suspended Rice indefinitely after video tape of the incident turned the original, paltry suspension into a PR nightmare for the league. A judge later overturned that second suspension because Rice was essentially being punished twice for the same crime, and because the NFL had no real evidence that Rice had lied during the league’s investigation into the incident. \n\nHe hit the New Orleans Saints with sweeping and severe penalties after determining that the team had instituted a bounty program. Those suspensions were later overturned by ex-commissioner Paul Tagliabue on the grounds that Goodell had overstepped his bounds and reached his decision based on faulty evidence. \n\nHe eagerly exploited the Adrian Peterson child abuse case as a way to restore his authority and brand as a stern, tough-minded disciplinarian. That suspension was later overturned by a federal judge because Goodell had retroactively and unfairly applied the league’s new domestic violence policy to Peterson’s case. \n\nAnd now this. This particular defeat feels more meaningful than the previous ones, though, in part because of how truly benign the original “crime” was. Those other suspensions being vacated were big victories for the NFLPA, but Goodell’s flanks were still protected by the fact that he was facing off with a child abuser, a wife-beater, and a football team that purposely tried to hurt people. No matter how slapdash and wrongheaded Goodell’s ersatz judicial processes were revealed to be, he was always able to position himself as a good guy, just trying to get tough on bad people and do the right thing. He was able to point to his failures as evidence that all he needed to Get Things Right in the future was more power. \n\nhttp://deadspin.com/roger-goodell \n\n-... \n\nIt’s much harder to imagine Goodell spinning this loss in his favor, though. There’s no monstrous crime with which to obscure his own failures this time. All Goodell has to protect himself with in this instance is that a few footballs that may or may not have been deflated by an amount that may or may not have made any real difference. This is to say that when Judge Richard Berman goes in on Goodell’s kangaroo court, essentially calling the whole operation flatly illegal, people are going to notice. \n\nNow, any player who is suspended by Goodell under the same suspect jurisdiction of…

0125_b76772fd-9df7-41de-a555-3bbf6c483421	US Open champion Novak Djokovic is honoured to be considered among the greats of the game and has warned his rivals he has many years left in him yet. \n \nDjokovic ousted world number two Roger Federer 6-4 5-7 6-4 6-4 to win his second title at Flushing Meadows and 10th major overall, moving the Serb to within one of Bjorn Borg on the Open era’s all-time list. \n \nAbove Borg sit both Rafael Nadal and Pete Sampras on 14 grand slam triumphs while Djokovic still remains seven short of Federer’s all-time best 17. \n \nThe 28-year-old, however, claimed three of the four grand slams in 2015 and has now reached 16 of the last 21 major finals. \n \nThe record is testament to Djokovic’s consistency at the top of the men’s game which, at his current rate, means there is a strong chance the Serb could match or even surpass Federer’s total. \n \n“We’ve got to double digits now,” Djokovic said. \n \n“And I’m so obviously flattered and honoured to be a part of an elite group of players, legends of our sports to manage to win this many grand slam trophies in their lives and careers. \n \n“So to be just mentioned alongside them is truly something special.” \n \nDjokovic is one of the greatest athletes the game has ever seen, taking meticulous care of his diet and physique, and it would be no surprise if his career extended well into his thirties. \n \n“I’m 28. I have always valued the care for my body and my mind and had this holistic approach to life,” Djokovic said. \n \n“I will continue on with the same kind of lifestyle, same kind of approach. I think that kind of approach brought me to where I am today. \n \n“Hopefully this kind of approach will give me longevity and that I can have many more years to come and, as I said, many more opportunities to fight for these trophies. \n \n“As long as there is this flare in me I will be coming back.” \n \nDjokovic’s only grand slam defeat this year came in the French Open final to Stan Wawrinka, meaning he went one better than his famous 2011 season, when he also won the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open but lost in the semi-finals at Roland Garros. \n \nThe Serb has been the stand-out player in the world again this year and believes his performances have been even better than four years ago. \n \n“I think it’s definitely more difficult to repeat something like that than actually doing it for the first time,” Djokovic said. \n \n“I’m a different player, a different person today than I was in 2011. \n \n“As a father and a husband, it’s a completely different approach to tennis today. \n \n“I feel more fulfilled. I feel more complete as a player today than I was in 2011 – physically stronger, mentally more experienced, and tougher as well. \n \n“I think being in the situation before helped me to understand particular obstacles that are on the way and how I need to overcome them, which I did last night.” \n \nDjokovic was a worthy winner against Federer, who came into the final having not dropped a set since Wimbledon in July, but the 34-year-old could not overcome his opponent’s relentless hitting and masterful defence. \n \nThe Swiss missed 19 break-point opportunities as Djokovic was more clinical in the important moments, showing his iron-will again to secure a hard-fought victory. \n \n“To win against one of the biggest rivals, an all-time grand slam champion, somebody that always keeps fighting till the last point, keeps making you play an extra shot – all these things now are very special to me,” Djokovic said. \n \n“This is a night that I will definitely remember for a very long time.” \n \nThe post appeared first on Press and Journal .

0131_3fe5bfa9-20ff-4f69-b1ec-bb9c75fe7a43	A potential death penalty trial in East Texas is set to resume on Monday after it was put on hold when a judge was said by a TV station to have had a shock belt used on the defendant for misbehaving. James Calvert, 45, of Tyler, Texas, is on trial in Smith County, where prosecutors allege he beat and fatally shot his former wife at her home and abducted their 4-year-old son in October 2012. Judge Jack Skeen allowed Calvert to defend himself, over objections from attorneys specializing in the death penalty, at the outset of the trial in August.
0132_8b893a57-1420-4392-b990-e0c0aaf68924	"Earlier this week, a soldier from Florida used a GoPro to show that his wife was physically abusing him, resulting in his estranged wife going to jail , according to WTSP-10, a local news Tampa Bay news station. \n\nThe solider, who’s been identified just as Michael in order to protect “his identity since he is a victim of domestic violence,” has been in a custody and divorce battle with his wife, 37-year-old Corinne Novak, WTSP reported. The captured GoPro video shows Novak hitting the solider below the belt during a custody exchange last week. \n\n""This is just one of many instances where I've had to use the camera to either prove her guilt or prove my innocence and that's the only reason I am carrying it,"" Michael said in the video. \n\nMichael told WTSP that the video will show the courts what his wife has been doing to him, which may solve the long custody battle the former couple has been having over their two 2-year-old daughters. \n\n“We have court coming up so hopefully it goes to show a little bit of validity to what I've been doing and what I've been saying and disapproving what she's been saying,"" Michael told WTSP. ""It seems to be overlooked when the man is a victim of domestic violence."" \n\nAlthough women make up the majority of domestic violence cases — close to 1.3 million annually, according to the American Bar Association — about 835,000 men across the United States are domestically abused by their partners every year, the ABA reported. The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said about one in seven men suffer intimate partner violence annually. \n\nAccording to Help Guide, a nonprofit organization that aims to help people’s health and well-being, most men tend to be stronger than women, but that doesn’t make it easy to escape an abusive relationship . In fact, men often lack the resources that women do when they’re abused, Help Guide explained. \n\n“An abused man faces a shortage of resources, skepticism from police, and major legal obstacles, especially when it comes to gaining custody of his children from an abusive mother,” according to Help Guide. \n\nMen also face the issue of being “socialized not to express their feelings or see themselves as victims,” according to The National Domestic Violence Hotline. Young boys are taught from a young age to show strength and not express emotions, which makes it difficult for men to recognize the signs that they’re being abused, the NDVH reported. \n\nWarning signs include partners calling them names, preventing them from going to work or threatening them with violence , according to The Mayo Clinic. \n\nSociety tends to treat male domestic violence as a joke, according to the NDVH. An example of this was seen last year when famed rapper Jay-Z was attacked by Solange Knowles, the sister of Jay-Z’s wife, Beyonce Knowles, according to the NDVH. The controversy inspired memes on the Internet and even a song lyric from Beyonce. \n\nDespite society’s views on male domestic violence and the lack of resources, men can find help with domestic abuse problems from a variety of sources. Help Guide recommends talking to physicians, psychologists and therapists on the issue. \n\nLocal authorities may also be a source of help. But men should try to get evidence of the abuse, like Michael did, to prove that they are being attacked since authorities are likely to be skeptical of the issue, Help Guide reported. \n\nMen should also look to leave their relationship to avoid abuse, and they should never retaliate, Help Guide reported. \n\nIt’s also important for men to speak out about their problems, despite societal pressures, according to the Mayo Clinic. This will help other men speak out about their domestic abuse issues, and might spark a societal change where it’s more common to come forward about attacks. \n\n“Start by telling someone about the abuse, whether it's a friend, relative, health care provider or other close contact,” The Mayo Clinic explained. “At first, you might find it hard to talk about the abuse. However, you'll also likely feel relief and receive much-needed support.”"
0133_6e03b453-7d91-4e45-971b-d86af601aa9c	"Agrium (NYSE:AGU) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Agrium's profit rose in the second quarter of 2015 on higher volumes in its Wholesale unit. However, adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues fell year over year on declines across the board, and missed expectations. The company cut its earnings guidance for 2015 factoring in pricing pressure in the second half. The crop pricing environment is expected to remain soft in the near term. Agrium is also faced with issues such as logistical constraints and challenges from higher Chinese urea exports.” \n\nBank of America (NYSE:BAC) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Bank of America’s second-quarter 2015 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the back of lower non-interest expenses as well as increase in interest income and mortgage banking revenues. However, a slump in trading revenues and investment banking fees, and higher provision for credit losses were the headwinds. We expect balance sheet restructuring efforts, expense reduction initiatives and improving asset quality to steadily bolster the company’s bottom-line growth. Further, conditional approval of its capital plan indicates overall balance sheet strength. Nevertheless, pressure on net interest yield, along with lower trading volumes, will continue to hurt top-line growth in the near term.” \n\nBarclays (NYSE:BCS) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Barclays’ first-half 2015 results reflected successful cost-curtailment measures and improvement in Investment Banking performance. However, a number of legal provisions and declining net operating income were the undermining factors. The decision to remove Chief Executive Antony Jenkins will likely help the company become more profitable through faster cost-cuts. Nevertheless, the company continues to face several headwinds. Primarily, muted top-line growth and a stringent regulatory landscape will likely weigh on the company’s near-term performance. Also, issues related to regulatory investigations will keep hindering its growth prospects.” \n\nBlackRock (NYSE:BLK) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “BlackRock’s second-quarter 2015 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by higher revenues. Growth in assets under management (AUM) was another catalyst. However, elevated expenses and long term outflows were the undermining factors. While the company continues to capitalize on opportunistic acquisitions to boost performance, its initiatives to enhance market share in the ETF business are expected to aid revenue growth going forward. Also, the company’s enhanced capital deployment activities remain impressive. Nonetheless, weak expense control, high dependence on fee-based revenues and regulatory restrictions on its revenue sources make us apprehensive.” \n\nBP plc (NYSE:BP) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a strong sell rating. According to Zacks, “BP plc’s earnings came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter. This was mainly due to lower realization. We believe that the company’s strategy of offloading non-core upstream properties will prove beneficial over time, while creating a portfolio with potentially stronger growth from a smaller base. Additionally, BP’s position in the Woodford, Haynesville, Fayetteville, Eagle Ford and Utica shale plays, in association with its vast resource base and profound knowledge in unconventional gas, will aid its natural gas operations going forward.” \n\nCitigroup (NYSE:C) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Citigroup's second-quarter 2015 adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were aided by lower expenses while revenues remained relatively stable. Also, the quarter experienced continued improvement in credit quality and exhibited a strong capital position. We believe the company's streamlining initiatives and attractive core business are impressive. Yet, a low interest-rate environment and regulatory issues, along with litigation risks, remain major near-term headwinds.” \n\nDr Pepper Snapple Group (NYSE:DPS) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Dr Pepper has sound long-term fundamentals — strong position in the flavored CSD market, aggressive RCI cost savings and regular cash returns to shareholders. After an exceptional performance in 2014, Dr Pepper delivered solid top line and bottom line results in the first half of 2015 on the back of pricing gains, innovations, powerful marketing programs and productivity improvements. Despite increased currency headwinds, the company raised the 2015 sales and EPS expectations. Improving U.S. consumer sentiments, rational pricing environment, increased marketing support and RCI driven cost savings will boost results in the second half. However, sluggish volumes of its carbonated beverages, including the diet versions, due to CSD category headwinds, are the concerns.” \n\nHarmony Gold Mining (NYSE:HMY) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Harmony Gold posted a wider loss on a reported basis in fourth-quarter fiscal 2015, hurt by a sizable impairment related to its Hidden Valley, Doornkop and Phakisa operations. Adjusted earnings were flat year over year. Revenues fell by double-digits,affected by lower gold sales and pricing. Gold production also declined year over year in the quarter. Harmony's operations are likely to be impacted by a slower-than expected ramp-up in production at mines and gold price volatility. It also remains exposed to geopolitical risks associated with potential mine shut downs and labor strikes.” \n\nIngersoll-Rand PLC (NYSE:IR) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Ingersoll reported disappointing second-quarter 2015 results, as adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.03. Operating risks from high R&D costs for technology-driven products are expected to weigh on margins in the quarters ahead. Moreover, intense competitive pressure and adverse foreign currency impact are likely to hinder its profitability to some extent. However, Ingersoll is realigning its operational structure to improve the long-term growth prospects and capitalize on high-margin opportunities. A disciplined capital allocation, strong and flexible balance sheet, and healthy cash flow remain positives. Ingersoll also expects to strengthen its position in existing markets through organic growth across industry verticals and maintained its earlier guidance for 2015.” \n\nNordstrom (NYSE:JWN) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Nordstrom reported better-than-expected top and bottom line results for second-quarter fiscal 2015 on the back of smooth execution of its customer strategy coupled with robust sales growth driven by its strategic growth investments. Further, the company raised its outlook for fiscal 2015 encouraged by the strong second-quarter results and the reclassification of receivables as ""held for sale"" related to the pending credit card transaction. Consequently, the company witnessed an uptrend in estimates. Additionally, we appreciate the company’s store-expansion strategy, which is expected to boost top-line growth. However, the seasonal nature of the company’s business and increased competition from industry players may prove deterrents.” \n\nKinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Kinder Morgan, Inc, registered a decline in the earnings and revenue during the second quarter. The company’s focus on natural gas has raised concern amid a sluggish natural gas price environment. We are also cautious considering the risks that include an increase in crude oil production and pricing at the CO2 segment, a decline in refined products or natural gas demand, and rising costs associated with organic growth projects.” \n\nLiberty Global plc – Class A (NASDAQ:LBTYA) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a strong sell rating. According to Zacks, “Liberty Global reported mixed financial results in the second quarter of 2015 wherein the bottom line fell below the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line steered past the same. The company is predominantly operating in Europe, which at present is economically the most vulnerable region. Ongoing debt crisis in several European countries may significantly affect the future prospect of Liberty Global. The intensely competitive pay-TV market of Germany further adds to the company’s woes. Moreover, high integration risks, mounting programing expenses and a highly leveraged balance sheet are major headwinds that face the company presently.” \n\nLyondellBasell Industries NV (NYSE:LYB) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “LyondellBasell’s profit jumped in the second quarter of 2015 as it benefited from abundant supply of low-cost natural gas. However, revenues fell by double-digits year over year, affected by lower prices of the company’s products. Adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate while sales missed. LyondellBasell remains on track with its expansion projects that are expected to boost capacity and add to its earnings. The company also remains committed to boosting shareholder returns by leveraging healthy cash flows. However, LyondellBasell is exposed to volatility in raw material and energy costs. Lower crude oil prices may also affect its margins in 2015. Moreover, its operations are subject to maintenance outages.” \n\nManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “ManpowerGroup’s second-quarter 2015 earnings per share of $1.33 and revenues of $4,861.3 million handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by encouraging performance in Southern Europe. In addition, the Permanent Recruitment business is doing well with revenues growth of 20% on constant currency basis. However, both the metrics disappointed on a year-over-year basis on account of unfavorable forex fluctuations coupled with weak performing Right Management business. Management expects recovery across globe to be slow and patchy going forward.  As recovery is slow, management has adopted a strong pricing and productivity control approach to ensure uninterrupted profitability.” \n\nMasco Corp (NYSE:MAS) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Masco Corporation’s earnings, revenues and margin increased year over year in the first two quarters of 2015. Masco reported strong sales at all segments, except Plumbing, in the first two quarters of 2015. Cost control and productivity improvements drove operating margin. Masco expects stronger demand for its leading products through the rest of 2015, as the repair and remodeling industry continues to improve. Moreover, the cabinet segment, which returned to profitability this quarter, is expected to gain further momentum in the second half of 2015. However, international revenues are being hurt by currency headwinds resulting from a weaker euro compared to the U.S dollar.” \n\nMeredith (NYSE:MDP) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Favorable advertising trends in the digital section and recent acquisitions continue to favorably impact Meredith’s performance. This is evident from the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results, wherein earnings of $0.94 per share grew 6.8% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the seventh straight quarter. Though revenues of $426 million came almost in line with the estimate, it grew 9% year over year. Waning print media trends and stiff competition continue to be immediate concerns. Nevertheless, Meredith is focused on bolstering advertising revenues, primarily in the digital space, and is increasingly concentrating on brand licensing, marketing services and e-Commerce. Recently, Media General has announced its decision to acquire Meredith.” \n\nMcCormick & Company, (NYSE:MKC) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “McCormick delivered better-than-expected earnings in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Earnings of $0.75 per share increased 17% from $0.64 per share earned a year ago, mainly due to a lower tax rate. Higher adjusted operating income, increased income from unconsolidated operations and lower shares outstanding also benefited earnings. Further, the company has raised its earnings guidance, citing favorable tax rates in fiscal 2015. However, revenues lagged the consensus mark and declined year-over-year due to significant foreign currency headwinds. Excluding currency impact, sales grew 5%. McCormick is focusing on building sales through brand marketing investments and acquisitions. However, McCormick remains apprehensive about higher material costs, which can impact 2015 earnings.” \n\nMicrosemi (NASDAQ:MSCC) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Microsemi Corporation is an OEM of a broad range of high-reliability and analog/mixed signal integrated circuits. Fiscal third-quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Also, forward revenue guidance was encouraging. Microsemi’s compelling products, scope for margin expansion and decent balance sheet are other positives. However, pockets of weakness related to the high-margin satellite business, product transition at medical customers, push-out of some communications spending in China and a softer oil & gas market will impact revenues. Also, heavy investment in R&D could impact near-term profitability.” \n\nMylan NV (NASDAQ:MYL) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Mylan’s second-quarter earnings were better than expected. We are encouraged by strong sales at the Generics segment. Mylan raised its 2015 guidance. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.15 to $4.35.  However, foreign currency exchange rates continue to negatively impact revenues. We remain concerned about the company’s Specialty segment sales. The company expects to face generic competition for EpiPen Auto-Injector in the second half of 2015. Meanwhile, Mylan remains committed to acquiring Perrigo Company and has launched a formal offer to acquire all outstanding ordinary shares of Perrigo.” \n\nNorthern Trust (NASDAQ:NTRS) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Northern Trust’s second-quarter 2015 earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from top-line growth and a benefit of credit in provision for credit losses. However, higher expenses and lower net interest margin remained concerns. The company remains committed to enhance shareholders’ value as it announced a dividend hike and a new share repurchase program. Though the thrust of banking regulations might act as deterrents to the company’s fundamentals going forward, strong capital ratios and anticipated increase in asset management and servicing fees based on a significant equity markets improvement and higher volumes are expected to support earnings in the coming quarters.” \n\nNewell Rubbermaid (NYSE:NWL) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Newell, which has been delivering positive earnings surprises for over four years now, reported stellar second-quarter 2015 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines improved year over year and exceeded expectations. Also, Newell raised its outlook for 2015 as it remains confident of delivering positive results in the second half of 2015 as well. Further, the company’s Project Renewal Program aimed at achieving annual cost savings, remains on track. Also, Newell’s solid brand portfolio is one of its key strengths. However, the company’s significant global presence exposes it to adverse currency movements. Despite the raised guidance, Newell expects forex headwinds to have a greater impact on its 2015 earnings as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against other currencies.” \n\nPotash Corp./Saskatchewan (NYSE:POT) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Potash Corp.’s profit fell in the second quarter of 2015, hurt by lower nitrogen prices.Earnings trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate whiles sales beat expectations. The company cut the top end of its earnings guidance range for 2015 factoring in pricing pressure and weak nitrogen market fundamentals. Potash Corp. faces headwinds associated with macroeconomic uncertainties stemming from weakness across specific developing markets. It is also exposed to challenges in its nitrogen business and a volatile pricing environment.” \n\nToyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a strong-buy rating to a hold rating. According to Zacks, “Toyota’s first-quarter fiscal 2016 net income and consolidated revenues improved year over year and surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Toyota expects its earnings, operating income and revenues to increase in fiscal 2016. The company’s focus on product development, capacity increases and expansion in emerging markets are positives. However, weak vehicle sales in Japan, a string of product recalls and large fines are some headwinds.” \n\nTorchmark (NYSE:TMK) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Torchmark's higher administrative expenses, pension costs and investments in IT systems will likely be a drag on the company's earnings over the near term. For 2015, management lowered the projected earnings range to $4.18–$4.28 from $4.20–$4.40 per share. However, niche market focus, steady capital deployment and strong operating fundamentals should drive long-term growth. The company estimates life and health sales growth in distribution channels. Additionally, strong capital position and capital management are also among other positives. With respect to earnings results, Torchmark's second-quarter earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but improved year over year on higher premium contribution from the life as well as insurance business.” \n\nUBS AG (NYSE:UBS) was downgraded by analysts at Deutsche Bank from a buy rating to a hold rating. \n\nXcel Energy (NYSE:XEL) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks from a hold rating to a sell rating. According to Zacks, “Xcel Energy has been heavily investing in transmission, generation and distribution projects which are expected to boost its performance going forward.  A large portion of the company’s capital expenditure in the next 4 to 5 years will be directed toward strengthening its transmission and natural gas business. Focus on adding renewables will help the company achieve its target of curbing carbon emissions. However, Xcel Energy’s earnings and revenues in the second quarter of 2015 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year due to lower revenues on account of unfavorable weather and a decline in residential sales. Apart from uncertain weather patterns, tighter environmental legislations might also limit the company' profitability.” \n\nReceive News & Ratings for Agrium Inc Daily - Enter your email address below to receive a concise daily summary of the latest news and analysts' ratings for Agrium Inc and related companies with MarketBeat.com's FREE daily email newsletter."

0135_1d4d1a14-7eb7-4be4-b1d5-7ac491c61dbd	I’m 56 years old, and I have finally discovered what a “grown-up” relationship really looks like.  I shake my head and try very hard not to regret many of the moments of those 56 years, but I’ve realized in the last year that I had no idea what a real, honest to goodness GROWN UP relationship really was. I have three incredibly horrible/wonderful children, and remind myself every single day how thankful I am for them. It’s because of them that I’ve come to know the real meaning of joy, true love, despair, fear, great pride and gratitude.  It’s also because of those three souls that I can’t regret the many years I spent in an unfortunate marriage.  (If I wasn’t still raw from the fact that someone who shall not be named managed to steal ½ of my TEACHER’S retirement, I might actually thank him for those children.) Last year The Powers That Be took pity on me. They knew I finally loved and respected myself, and I guess they decided I was ready to be loved by someone else.  But this time they sent someone my way who is kind, generous, loving, handsome, funny and who can dance like nobody’s business.  They sent me a real man. You know what I’ve realized a grown-up relationship means? Most of you are probably lucky enough to already know, but I’m going to share my own earth shattering realizations about what a real man in a grown-up relationship really does. First, a real man doesn’t play any crazy games. He doesn’t wait to call you, he doesn’t ignore your text messages or phone calls, and he makes you feel like you are the only and best partner in the world. He loves to hear your voice in the morning, and wants to hear it before he goes to sleep. He reminds you each day that you are important to him and that you are an important part of his life. Second, he’s honest. He tells you when you are wonderful, and when you are sounding a bit crazy. He tells you when you look beautiful and when you might want to donate that well-worn blue dress to the Goodwill.  He admires your children for their strengths, and gently reminds you when they make a misstep.  (Moms are a bit blind in some instances…it’s that maternal component that brings on an occasional bout of blindness.) Third, he makes it easy for YOU to be honest.  He listens to my boring stories, my silly fears and my occasional trips into the world of crazy ranting.  He never makes me feel like I should hide any of these sides of myself, and always has a response that makes me laugh.  Sometimes I think I share WAY TOO MUCH, but that’s because my heart is so at ease with this man.   And while I could go on and on,  do you know one of the best things of all about being in this particular grown-up relationship? (Well, besides the fact that I’m crazy about him…)   He’s decided that he needs to show me a world I’ve never seen before.  And when I say the world, I really mean it. Buckle up, cause vodkamom’s adventures have been raised to an entirely new level.....

0137_f122dac7-4d79-4d19-bac1-88c8f468e33d	Monday on “The Alan Colmes Show,” Alan spoke with Milwaukee Country Sheriff David Clarke about his controversial comments that President Obama and former Attorney General Eric Holder were to blame for the death of Deputy Darren Goforth in Texas.  He also discussed why he thinks the #blacklivesmatter protesters across the country are also part of the problem. \n \nSheriff Clarke told Alan why he thinks President Obama has “disdain for the American police officer,” why #blacklivesmatter protesters should be demonstrating in front of abortion clinics and not police stations, and why much of the anti-police sentiment in America is due to the “lie” of “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot.”
0138_46cc051e-ab62-46fc-b65c-6ee2fa616c99	"10:09 a.m. EDT \n \nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain reached the Davis Cup final for the first time in 37 years on Sunday as Andy Murray outclassed Australia's Bernard Tomic in straight sets to give them an unbeatable 3-1 lead. \n \nWorld number three Murray had teamed up with brother Jamie to win a thrilling five-set doubles rubber against Lleyton Hewitt and Sam Groth on Saturday to leave the hosts needing to win just one of Sunday's reverse singles. \n \nThe 28-year-old, who became the first Briton to win the Wimbledon men's singles in 77 years in 2013, duly delivered his third point of the match, beating an increasingly dispirited Tomic 7-5 6-3 6-2 to wild cheers from a partisan Glasgow crowd. \n \nIn doing so, and setting up a final away to Belgium, Murray improved his record in Davis Cup singles to 25-2 -- an impressive contribution and the main reason Britain have risen from the depths of the competition in 2010 to within one victory of their first title since 1936. \n \n""Obviously, winning for your country and your team mates means a lot. The crowd were unbelievable from the first ball to the last,"" Murray told the BBC. \n \n""I didn't feel great the whole weekend to be honest, I've been struggling with my back, but I just tried to disguise it. We've got everyone here, mother, father, wife, grandmother, mother-in-law, aunties and uncles. \n \n""I'm delighted to get through, we knew this would be difficult, Australia have so much depth and experience but we fought extremely hard all weekend."" \n \nMurray's only moment of alarm on Sunday came in the first set when Tomic briefly raised his level, breaking back from 2-5 down to level the set at 5-5. \n \nHowever, the Australian, who is ranked 23 in the world, slipped 0-40 down at 5-6 and, despite saving two set points, was bamboozled by a Murray drop shot. \n \nAfter that the outcome of the match became a formality as a clearly tired Murray managed to dominate. \n \nAustralia captain Wally Masur said Murray had been the difference between the sides. \n \n""Andy was like a locomotive this weekend,"" he said. \n \n""I think you walk away from those ties and say: 'Where do we need to get better?' and 'What do I need to improve?'. I think Andy showed our boys."" \n \nMurray will need to summon one final effort at the end of the season when Britain will face Belgium, probably in Brussels, on Nov. 27-29 after they edged past Argentina 3-2 on Sunday. \n \n(Reporting by Martyn Herman in London; editing by Clare Fallon and Ken Ferris)"
0139_b18df561-a32f-433e-b141-c1e586dcf364	ST. LOUIS -- With the Pittsburgh Pirates not letting up, the St. Louis Cardinals have little margin for error in the National League Central.But St. Louis had Jaime Garcia on the mound Saturday night and that - coupled with a big first inning - was more than enough for it to maintain its lead.Checking the Milwaukee Brewers on seven hits and a run over eight innings, Garcia became the fifth Cardinals starter to reach double figures in wins in a 5-1 victory at sold-out Busch Stadium.Garcia (10-5), who walked none and fanned eight, beat Milwaukee for the third time since Aug. 8. The only trouble he experienced occurred in the sixth, when rookie outfielder Michael Reed doubled in his first big league at-bat and later scored on a single by first baseman Jonathan Lucroy.The result enabled St. Louis (98-57) to hold its three-game lead on Pittsburgh, a 4-0 winner Saturday at the Chicago Cubs. The Cardinals and Pirates meet in Pittsburgh for a three-game series starting Monday night.Rookie starter Tyler Wagner (0-1) gave up six hits and five runs over four innings in his second big league start for the Brewers (65-90). Wagner walked four and struck out Carnone. St. Louis roared out to a 4-0 lead in the first inning. Left fielder Matt Holliday laced an RBI double to the wall in left-center, followed two batters later by a run-scoring single from shortstop Jhonny Peralta. Second baseman Kolten Wong capped the rally with a two-run single.Holliday ripped his second RBI double an inning later to make it 5-0.Garcia cruised through the first five innings, yielding just two singles and walking none with five strikeouts. NOTES: St. Louis RHP Carlos Martinez (right shoulder tightness) is being shut down for the year, but won't need surgery. Martinez, who finished 14-7 with a 3.01 ERA in his first year as a starter, left Friday night's game after seven pitches. ... Milwaukee RF Ryan Braun (lower back tightness) returned to the starting lineup for the first time since Sept. 18. Braun pinch-hit Friday night. ... Cardinals RHP Adam Wainwright (left Achilles) threw 27 pitches in a simulated game, recording strikeouts of 1B Matt Adams and OF Randal Grichuk. Wainwright, who also worked on fielding and covering first base, could pitch next week during a trip to Pittsburgh and Atlanta.

0141_f97d0baf-09f1-4b6d-bbe6-0f0402de1aae	It's 5 o' clock in the evening. The sky is dotted with a plethora of colours. It seems that a myriad of hues have carelessly been splashed on a canvas, the end product being a striking and stunning palette of colours. Shifting our vision downward to earth, to rooftops specifically, numerous young children and young-at-heart adults can be spotted laughing, playing, running about and most importantly, thoroughly enjoying themselves and having fun, all the time holding a reel of thread in their hands. Now and then, a cry of “bho katta!”  is heard. Oh, the joy and delight experienced on cutting someone else's line and seeing their kite floating off into the vast horizon. Alas, this type of scene isn't too common anymore.  \n \nIn a world that is becoming increasingly virtual, where tech-savvy kids prefer staying indoors rather than playing a sport outside, the art of kite flying has become a lost art. These days, how many kids do we know who indulge in flying kites as a pastime? How many shops do we encounter in the local market or bazaar, which sells kites? \n \n Truth be spoken, the answers to both the above questions would be near to none. Presently, kites are flown only on special occasions like Vishwakarma Puja or in organised kite festivals. \n \nThe kite traces its roots to China, where the materials ideal for kite building were easily available namely silk fabric for sail material, fine, high-tensile strength silk for flying lines and flexible bamboo for a strong yet light framework.  \n \nFrom China, traders to Korea and across Asia to India eventually spread kite flying. There are quite a few variations to the designs of kites, they are the Deltas, the triangular kites, easy flyers for low to medium winds, the Serpents and Dragons with long, graceful flowing tails, the visually striking Rokkakus, a traditional Japanese design, and finally the Diamonds, the classic kite design.  \n \nAll these can be seen at the various kite festivals held all around the world. Be it the Japan kite festival, or those in China and Jakarta, Indonesia, each of them are an integral part of the local culture and have a widespread appeal.  \n \nThe highly acclaimed Washington State International Kite Festival and the International Kite Festival of India in Gujarat attract thousands of competitors as well as spectators from around the world.  \n \nMy first encounter with kites was at my grandparents' house, when I was about two years old. My grandfather used to stack a pile of kites of several colour to choose from, he used to do this every time we visited them.  \n \nAlthough I had no clue about how to fly a kite, the feeling of running with a kite in one hand and the reel in the other, the wind caressing my face and my hair flying, was pure bliss and joy in itself. My kite never left the ground!  \n \nAnd till today, I haven't been successful in getting a kite up in the air. But then, there’s hope yet. \n \nDiotima Roy, Class X, DPS Ruby Park \n \nSky battles \n \nI am accustomed to my daily waking up at six o 'clock when a new grey morning summons me with fervour. I sit for some time on my broad window-sill engaged in my usual overwhelming caprice.  \n \nHowever one day some unknown force compelled me to stay a bit longer near the window and gaze mysteriously at the endless sky and attempt hard to make out the skyline. The silvery majestic outline of the moon found its place in the vast sky. \n \nMy commendations for these little beauties became intense when abruptly my eye caught the view of a minute object in constant motion.  That was a kite. It gyrated vigorously and then rose higher and higher. I figured out an urchin on the roof of his decrepit house adroitly manipulating the non-living flying object that was crimson coloured with a glittery silver border and a long frail mustard coloured ribbon for tail creating tortuous motion in the air. The air seemed extremely pleasurable with no extreme turbulence or pure stagnancy. The sun appeared to have taken a day's repose. \n \nGradually there appeared another kite; analogously larger in dimension painted with a thin coat of indigo hue and black horizontal stripes pasted impetuously on its surface. It had no ribbons.  \n \nA fierce rumpus commenced and the two inanimate objects were soon engaged in a grapple where the sky volunteered to serve as the battleground and the kites were the soldiers thriving hard to overcome the hindrance. Ponderously kites engulfed the sky and the battle grew heftier. After some time there was a screech or two followed by dismantling of a kite that swirled round and descended over a still moss-enveloped pond. Alas, the soldier capitulated to its mighty opponent. Instantly a thunderous howl echoed in the alleyway and a sea of young folk emerged to have a look at the vista.  \n \nWhat a great raging sky battle! I desperately wished to be a part of this surging combat in which we find ourselves defeated optimistically; a battle in which we know no physical maltreat but pure mental stability; a battle in which we have no winner but a survivor; a battle we all crave for: the sky battle. \n \nHrishita Chatterjee, Class XI, St Teresa's Secondary School, Khidderpore \n \nIf only I were a kite... \n \nWhen I was 10 years old, I had read about the Phoenix somewhere - about its mythological significance and magical immortality. Since then I have always had a strange jealousy for flying objects - be it birds or aeroplanes. \n \nMay be that is why when I went to the terrace the other day to vent my the heaviness in my heart in the cool autumn winds, I happened to have forgotten all my miseries, staring fixedly at a red object flying in the sky, looking like a red dot in an azure ocean. It was a kite- a medium sized, diamond shaped kite that was painted in a thick red paint from head to tail and highlighted with a solid black circle at its centre. It was held in space by an almost invisible thread that originated somewhere behind the bushy, green coconut trees. I had been staring at it for sometime while churning my grievances in my mind when suddenly, my brows stitched in anger at the flying kite. Another flying thing. How I seemed to dislike it. \n \nI was wondering why was it dancing before my gaze high up in the heavens when I was not even interested in it. It floated in the sky, occasionally fluttering because of the wind, and soaring again like an artificial bird. Soon the neighbourhood responded to this colour in the sky and kites were seen emerging on the distant horizon like enemy flags progressing for the battle field. A yellow in the north west corner and two greens - one emerald painted, the other in shades of olive- flew into the sky (it seemed like an arena) from the south and soon all of them flew together in the air harmoniously.  \n \nThen suddenly the emerald kite made a quick progress towards the yellow one while the string of the yellow kite could be seen being pulled. Awed by the excitement I strained my eyes when the yellow one sliced through the invisible thread of the emerald's and flew away while the torn kite now sailed down the heavens and managed to tangle itself in one of the branches of the mango tree in the neighbourhood. \n \nFor a moment, I laughed. Having forgotten all my worries, I was so immersed in the kites that I had never noticed the long missed smile on my face. I wished I were a kite too. \n \n One that could soar in the skies fearlessly and trip over coconut tree tops. I wish I would be like it, gathering no moss from the hardships that came my way instead floating down to the earth, accepting my defeat wholeheartedly.  \n \nI wish I were a kite which could be as patient while waiting for a soul to gear up my spirits or may be have a heart that never lost its colours despite the wait for a human friend.  \n \nI wish I were a kite that would refrain to show its feelings even at being torn or which would believe in oneself while lying on the ground, waiting to join its company in the sky.  \n \nAhendrila Goswami, Class XII, Bishop Morrow School, Krishnagar \n \nFlying dreams \n \nSunset is turning the sky a golden orange. Inside the congested four walls of my room, one can look straight at the lamp post. There seems to be a conversation going on between two crows. Suddenly some yellow frames bloom onto the scene.  \n \nOverhead the sky is fast changing into different colours. Beside the highway, are large pandals and inside is the one with four hands, sitting with a 'latai and ghuri' (spool and kite) in his hand. Wishes are flying in the sky.  \n \nWe can never be birds. \n \nLook at the sky. Our dream is to be a bird, of flying in the sky. But I feel like a prisoner. The10ft/10ft room has blocked me. But in my childhood days, I used to run with the kite in my hand to send it off the sky.  \n \nThose days are lost. Where did all those friends go with whom I would spend hours with kites? Where did that big ground disappear, the green grass, and all our flying kites in the sky? See, how a kite is racing to catch another one and if it catches by chance, it's “bhokatta”! But the dreams end here.  \n \nAnother 'moyurponkhi' in the sky, 'the flying dream'. In our life also there is the same kinds of 'ups and downs'. Look at the boy in tattered clothes running to catch a 'kata ghuri', running and running. And when he catches the kite, his dream will be fulfilled.  Gradually darkness is covering the sky. \n \nThe lights are being lit up in the pandals. But at the extreme western point, even now different colours paint the sky. See, there is still that kite, 'a flying dream'. \n \nAnkita Mukherjee, Class XII, Coordinator, Vivekananda English Academy \n \nImagination is the highest kite that can fly, but the flight could be far more enjoyable, if one could only imagine. Kites have always offered a pure pleasure. People fly kites in different countries to make the festivals colourful, which on the other hand add freshness to life. Most likely, in Japan Children's Day on 5 May, New Year's programme of Korea, March festivals of Thailand, China's Lighting Festivals, America's spring festivals witness the same. \n \nIn India, Mughal emperors used to fly kites for their enjoyment. Now, in every state the kite flying competition is being carried on. In Patanga-nagar of Ahmedabad, there is an international Kite Flying Competition, which is organised every year. \n \nIn our country the kite is being used in favour of national integration, anti-religious conflict. In Bengal, the Kite-flying celebration particularly marks the occasion of Viswakarma-Puja. Various people had used kites for various measures. Some used it as symbol for defiant euphoria and hence to resist attack, some for experimentation while some for mere fun.  About 50 years back, kite-flying was a tremendous exciting carefree game in Bengal rural areas as it involved manufacturing of kite, then binding and adjusting the balance. \n \n Manufacturing the thread involves collection of glass pieces mostly of electric bulb or the pieces of the streetlights, or of train. Then a dust of it was made by iron mortar and pestle and the finer dust is collected. The moist sago is then boiled for a considerable time and when it is in semi-solid stage, the identifying colour is added and it is allowed to cool.  \n \nThen the reel of thread is held at one end, and collected on a spool by another. In the middle, one boy is supposed to hold the sago paste in his palm and one experienced boy holds the glass dust with the help of a cotton cloth. The sago paste has to be drawn up into the thread by rolling the spool. The thread is mixed with sago paste, then dust of glass is added and becomes sharp. Then the threads are tugged tightly from one post to another.  And we get the reinforced string prepared for kites.   \n \nBut times have changed. There are none around for engaging in such laborious activities. Leave alone preparing the strong glass-dust thread, very few boys can be found chasing kites and returning with whoops of joy on getting hold of one. \n \nAnnesha Chatterjee, Coordinator, Class IX, Kalyani University Experimental School, Kalyani
0142_df6c4181-8639-4674-a0c7-881114f8a6a8	By now we’ve forgotten the State Fair entirely, and want nothing to do with it. Autumn is here and we must be industrious and orient ourselves towards Omnipresent Pumpkin Spice Season. Oh, it’s nice today; it would be a good day at the Fair, even though the breeze had an undertone of chill in the morn. Noon feels warm, but that’s not going to last. \n \nIt’s possible you’ll go back to the Fairgrounds for something or other. I used to go to an Arts & Crafts event in the fall - and of course there’s the Back to the Fifties event in June, which occupies the Fairgrounds with so much gorgeous metal you really don’t see the bones of the Fair at all, even though they’re all there. In the Fall, however, it seems wrong to go there. It’s like going home and finding every store downtown empty and shuttered. Your parents moved away and didn't leave a forwarding address. \n \nAnyway: here’s a picture I never got around to posting. I like it because it’s shorthand, and everyone knows what it means. \n  \nBut only because it’s an Italian restaurant. If you saw IT GAR BR on an auto-parts store, you’d be completely confused. \n \nSomeone who's just learning English might be confused, though. What's a Meatbaii? \n \nCOMICS The creator of Marmaduke explains his appeal: \n “He’s not a talking dog,” Mr. Anderson said. “He doesn’t have a balloon above his head, he doesn’t walk on his hind legs. He walks and does things a real dog would do.”  \nMarmaduke has been around since 1954. His creator, Brad Anderson, has died at the age of 91. The obit concludes with the saddest thing you might read today. \n Mr. Anderson said that his cartoon helped fill a void for older people who could no longer keep an animal.“I get a lot of letters from people who are in retirement homes, and sometimes they can’t keep a dog anymore, so this is their pet,” he said. “They watch the paper for it, and they clip it out and put it in scrapbooks.”  \nSigh. \n \nTECH The Apple Event yesterday generated the usual coverage: They’re not innovating any more, and Steve Jobs would be unhappy. Well, the Fall event is usually about the second version of the latest phone - fine-tuning, not reinvention. As for Steve Jobs weeping from the great beyond because they’re selling a Stylus, well, Jobs was not an infallible being, and made a number of design mistakes, from the hockey-puck mouse to the irritating little thumb-wheel volume control on QuickTime. (I raise a glass to other UI nerds who remember such pointless things.) If you want a Stylus, they are making the best one you’d use. If you don’t want one you don’t need it. As for the keyboard, OF COURSE it’s just like a Surface. I have a friend who uses a Surface because he’s in the PC world and loves the keyboard; it’s his everyday out-and-about computer. The iPad cannot be your everyday out-and-about computer because typing on glass is a pain. My wife uses an iPad for everything, and she uses a Bluetooth computer. Whatever works. \n \nThe real news is the Apple TV upgrade. Yes, a new remote is not MIND-BLOWING INNOVATION, except for the part about voice control and a glass-panel trackpad for navigation. I use the AppleTV every day, and like the idea of the app store and voice control, especially for my wife, who tires of going click-click-click through the alphabet to find a show. \n \nIf the Roku has the ability to read your mind right now, I don’t particularly care, and if you prefer a Roku to AppleTV I don’t particularly care, either: enjoy your choice! Who cares what other people like?
0143_f2eccbef-f8e3-4217-867e-6a97a73121f2	"Same-sex marriage was supposed to be a settled matter in America -- it's a constitutional right -- but the issue returned to headlines this month after a Kentucky county clerk refused to license those nuptials. \n \nHere are eight things to know about Kim Davis, who spent five days in jail for refusing to abide by this summer's historic ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage. The same judge who jailed her for contempt ordered her release on Tuesday. Kim Davis is the elected clerk of Rowan County in northeastern Kentucky, along the edge of the Appalachian Mountains. \n\nShe is a Democrat who was first elected last fall with 3,909 votes, or 53% of the vote. The county has 23,655 residents. \n\nThough on the job only since January, Davis is hardly new to its demands. \n\nHer mother was the county clerk for 37 years, and Davis worked 27 years for her. \n\nDavis, 49, has spent her entire life in Rowan County, where 96% of people are white and more than one-fourth live in poverty. \n\nWhy was she jailed? \n\nDavis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, defying the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that legalized same-sex marriage. \n\n""It is not a light issue for me. It is a heaven or hell decision,"" Davis said in a statement, citing her religion. \n\nDavis doesn't want her name and title affixed to a same-sex marriage license ""that goes down in the annals of Kentucky history,"" said her attorney, Mat Staver. \n\nOn September 3, U.S. District Court Judge David Bunning declared Davis in contempt of court for refusing to issue the licenses and not allowing her six deputy clerks to issue them for her. He said Davis would remain behind bars until she complied. \n\nFive of her deputies then agreed to issue marriage licenses in her absence, and the Rowan County Clerk's Office began doing so the following day. \n\nThe sixth deputy is Davis' son, Nathan, who didn't give an answer when he appeared in court to discuss whether he would issue same-sex marriage licenses. \n\nDavis' defense failed to sway the judge. \n\n""You can't be separated from something that's in your heart and in your soul,"" she told the judge, according to CNN affiliate WKYT-TV. \n\nWhy was she released? \n\nJudge Bunning said in his order Tuesday that he is satisfied the office is issuing marriage licenses to ""legally eligible couples,"" and ordered that counsel for the five deputy clerks who agreed to issue such licenses to submit a status report every 14 days to ensure that compliance continues. \n\nBunning ordered Davis not to interfere ""directly or indirectly"" with the efforts of her deputies in those duties, and that ""appropriate sanctions will be considered"" if she fails to comply with the order. \n\nWhat is her faith? \n\nDavis experienced a religious conversion 4½ years ago and became an Apostolic Christian, a faith which has a strict moral code. She attends Solid Rock Apostolic Church in Morehead, the county seat. \n\n""She said she played in the devil's playground for a long time, and her life has been radically changed since then,"" attorney Staver said. \n\nShe has been married four times, including twice to the same man. \n\n""I am not perfect. No one is,"" Davis said in a statement. ""But I am forgiven and I love my Lord and must be obedient to him and to the word of God."" \n\nWill she resign or step down? Can she be fired? \n\nThe governor has no legal authority to remove Davis and cannot use an executive order to relieve her of statutory duties, he said. \n\nDuring Davis' time in jail, her attorney said the county clerk has no intention of resigning. \n\n""She will remain the clerk of Rowan County as long as the people want her,"" Staver said."

Reuters/Carlos Barria    \nU.S. President Barack Obama will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of the Iran nuclear agreement reached in July, the White House said on Wednesday. \n\nThe announcement was in response to a Republican bill introduced in Congress that would prevent the president from providing sanctions relief to Iran until $40 billion dollars in restitution has been paid to American victims of Iranian-backed terrorism. \n \n  \n(Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Julia Edwards )
0151_53308703-b9bb-4162-a73a-036c3affe3aa	"9/29/2015 \n \nPROVIDENCE - President Obama is encouraging all 4th-graders to explore the nation's recreational areas, including the Roger Williams National Memorial in Providence, through the new federal Every Kid In a Park initiative. \n \nFourth-grade students can go to www.everykidinapark.gov to do an activity and obtain a free annual entry pass to more than 2,000 federal recreation areas and national parks. Students and their families can use the pass through Aug. 31, 2016. The website also includes fun and engaging learning activities aligned to educational standards, trip planning tools, safety and packing tips and other important and helpful information for educators and parents. \n \nThe goal of the Every Kid in a Park program is to connect 4th-graders with the great outdoors and inspire them to become future environmental stewards, ready to preserve and protect national parks and other public lands for years to come. It is part of the National Park Service's centennial celebration in 2016. \n \n""During the National Park Service's centennial celebration, we want everyone to get to know their national parks, and we're offering a special invitation to 4th-graders and their families to discover everything that national parks offer,"" said National Park Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis. ""We hope these free passes for 4th-graders will introduce 4th-graders, their classes, and families to our national treasures, places where they can run and play, explore and learn."" \n \nEvery Kid in a Park is an administrative-wide effort, launched by President Obama, and supported by eight federal agencies, including the National Park Service, the Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, Department of Education, Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \n \nThe Roger Williams National Memorial, at 282 North Main St., in Providence, offers a variety of educational programs and activities for students. For more information on the memorial, visit www.nps.gov/rowi/learn/education/index.htm or call 401-521-7266."
0152_73a34d75-3fc5-4047-91c3-b0cce6f7c1da	WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration says the fingerprints of 5.6 million people who applied for or received a federal security clearance were stolen -- not 1.1 million as first believed. \n\nThat sobering news comes from the Office of Personnel Management, the federal personnel agency whose data was hacked in what officials believe was a Chinese espionage operation. \n\nAn estimated 21.5 million current and former federal employees or job applicants were affected in a data theft that experts say will give Chinese intelligence a huge leg up in recruiting informants. It could also help the Chinese catch U.S. spies. \n\nThe agency says the ability of an U.S. adversary to misuse fingerprint data is limited. But for intelligence operatives, the notion that the Chinese have their fingerprints is a nightmare.
0153_06f4b172-0ef7-4a11-9e4f-07f24152e425	"(CNN) -  \nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a frequent target of some of Jimmy Fallon's barbs, showed an easy rapport with the host on ""The Tonight Show"" Monday night, armed with an amusing anecdote about his New Hampshire visit with the Romneys and the Rubios and joking about the upcoming CNN GOP presidential debate. \n \nHe also took a couple lighthearted shots at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. \n\nDeclaring he was ""fired up"" to be on the show, the 2016 candidate opened the interview by insisting on participating in one of the show's notorious lip sync battles. But Christie was quickly shut down after launching into the opening lines of ""Born in the U.S.A."" by his famously beloved Bruce Springsteen, with Fallon slamming the buzzer and declaring Christie the winner. \n\nChristie, winking at his slipping poll numbers, quipped, ""Wow, my first first place! That's really good."" \n\nThe New Jersey governor also shared a story from his stay at Mitt Romney's lakeside home in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, over the Fourth of July weekend, during which he was accompanied by fellow 2016 GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio and his family. Christie described a spontaneous boating trip to a local ice cream store gone awry, whereupon arriving at the shop with a small horde of children and grandchildren, he, Romney and Rubio discovered, uncomfortably, that they had forgotten to bring enough money to pay for the crowd's ice cream demands. \n\n""So Mitt Romney turns to me and he says, 'By the way, do you have any money?' Mitt Romney! Right?,"" Christie joked. ""I said, 'No, I don't have any money, I didn't know we were going for ice cream.'"" He continued, ""So he turns to Rubio and he says, 'Do you have any money?' Rubio goes, 'I don't have any money.'"" \n\nThen came the punchline: ""So...our wives are walking behind us, and finally we hear a voice from behind going, 'Don't worry, would-be presidents, I have it handled.' And it was Ann Romney. She had the money."" \n\nThe would-be president also addressed the domination of the crowded 2016 GOP field by Donald Trump during the interview. Asked by Fallon if he had expected Trump's surge in the polls, Christie sarcastically replied ""Oh, no, I completely expected that -- didn't you?"" \n\nThe governor then teased the GOP frontrunner over his notorious self-confidence, breaking into his best Trump impression to add, ""Of course. Everything he does is fabulous, spectacular, wonderful, amazing."" \n\nLater in the interview, Christie discussed his performance in the first GOP presidential debate and his plans for the second debate, scheduled to take place on CNN on September 16. \n\nComplaining about the lack of opportunities to speak, he noted that during the first debate ""There was one point where I went twenty questions in a row without being asked a question. And that's hard."" \n\n""I'm standing up there next to Marco Rubio and we're looking at each other and going, 'Are we still here?'"" \n\nBut Christie promised to make his presence felt at the second debate. ""By the way, stay tuned on September 16th. We may be changing tactics. If I go -- if I get to fifteen questions in a row -- count them at home -- if I get that fifteen in a row, they're gonna go 'Uh-oh, he's going nuclear now,'"" adding ""if I turn green and get the hulk thing going."" \n\nThe second GOP presidential debate will take place at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Fingers crossed for an appearance by the hulk."

He has acknowledged the need for higher tax rates on higher incomes. Has said that Hillary Clinton ""would be good"" as a leader. Has said he is ""more of a Democrat than people might think."" Has said he has ""no idea"" why he's a Republican. Against Us:\nThose comments are from some time ago.  Sadly, today's Trump has reversed his positions on all of the above.   Recent surveys show that the large majority of his supporters believe that Obama is a Muslim who was not born in the U.S., want to repeal the 14th Amendment and eliminate birthright citizenship, and are in favor of deporting all immigrant children immediately. Which means most of Trump's supporters are low-information idiots and racists."

But in Hungary, where a bottleneck had trapped thousands of migrants in large camps before neighboring borders were opened, t the prime minister is urging the completion of a 13-foot fence at its border with Serbia before the end of this year. \n \n""Hungary says the migrants are mostly fleeing bad economic conditions, and don't need asylum status to protect their lives,"" NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports. ""Hungarian police are hindering migrants in their trek through southeast Europe towards the West. Romania says migrant quotas are not the solution; the E.U. says countries must come together in solidarity if Europe is to surmount the crisis."" \n \nOn Monday, both France and Britain pledged to accept thousands of migrants – but the numbers – 24,000 for France and 20,000 for Britain – are vastly different from the pace set by Germany, which over this past weekend welcomed at least 20,000 migrants . Chancellor Angela Merkel also said that Germany is devoting $6.7 billion to cope with the crisis. \n \nAs for what steps the U.S. might take, the White House says it is looking at ""a range of approaches to be more responsive to the global refugee crisis, including with regard to refugee resettlement."" \n \nThe administration adds that with the U.S. having provided over $4 billion in humanitarian assistance since the Syrian crisis began, and over $1 billion in assistance this year, ""The U.S. is the single largest donor to the Syrian crisis."" \n \nSo far in 2015, more than 367,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea to seek safety and better prospects in Europe, according to the UN Refugee Agency . Of that number, more than 244,000 made their landing in Greece; at least 121,000 reached Italy. \n \nThe UN agency says the number of migrants rose sharply in August, to nearly 130,000."
0158_cfe07b42-a15c-4607-bf79-4bf2bbd729ea	It’s hard to play better than Tom Brady did Thursday night. \n \nYet despite the New England Patriots quarterback’s  elite performance against the Pittsburgh Steelers, there still are two NFL quarterbacks who will have him beat this season. \n \nThat’s the consensus of 28 executives from around the league, who were asked by NFL.com’s Albert Breer in August to predict who the NFL’s top five quarterbacks  will be at season’s end. Here were their responses: \n \n1. Aaron Rodgers, Green Bay Packers \n2. Andrew Luck, Indianapolis Colts \n3. Tom Brady, Patriots \n4. Ben Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh Steelers \n5. Tony Romo, Dallas Cowboys \n \nPatriots fans might disagree, but it’s hard to argue with putting Rodgers and Luck at the top of the heap. Breer asked the executives not to factor in past history when making their decisions, and they had particularly high praise for Rodgers, who received 18 of 28 first-place votes. \n \n“He’s so smart, so accurate, so competitive, such a fast decision maker,” an NFC exec told Breer. “And I know it’s generic to say a lot of this, but he really is a 10 out of 10 in a lot of categories.” \n \nLeague executives did acknowledge Brady will be especially motivated this season — something we certainly found out in Week 1 — and that he isn’t exactly a guy you want to face in a big game. \n \n“I think he’s coming back with a chip on his shoulder, like he did after they lost a couple games early last year,” an NFC exec said of Brady. “He’s such a competitor — no one like him — and he’s got the proven track record. And I think what I’d based it on is, of all these guys, I sure don’t want to be playing against him.” \n \nA notable name left out of the Top 5: Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, who NFL executives ranked 6th. \n \nThumbnail photo via Mark L.

0159_8f7e2dac-23d4-412e-882b-ba3840ee2bdd	"Promotional Products have been around for a very long time, we figure it would be interesting to see the evolution of promotional products since they first made their debut in 1789!\n\n1789 - George Washington created commemorative buttons to mark the event that he was elected president. Because of the success in his campaign, wooden promotional items such as almanacs, calendars, rulers and wooden items became popular.\n1864 - A ferrotype with a locking pin was made for Abraham Lincoln the year he was reelected.  This pin was sold by vendors at campaign rallies or sold in small quantities to vendors.\n\n1886 - A man by the name of Jasper Meek is known to most as the father of the industry of promotional products.  Meek was a newspaper salesman who wanted to keep his presses running during slow times.  After seeing a child drop her schoolbooks on a dirt road, he had an idea that he would use his printing press to print advertising messages on burlap bags.  He sold the bags to his friend Mr. Cantwell who gave the bags out for free to children who came into his store.  The end result?  Mr. Cantwell's message: ""Buy Cantwell Shoes"" was seen all over town and Meek found a way to stay busy during his slow season.\n\n1889 - Meek had a good streak of selling his bags without competition until another newspaper salesman, Henry D. Beach decided he was going to start printing advertising messages on anything that could be ran through a printing press: aprons, caps, hats for horses, bags for marbles, buggy whips, card cases, calendars and fans.\n\n1896 - The first presidential election to mass-produce campaign buttons\n\nSecond Part of the 19th Century - Adolphus Busch, helped pioneer more than the Anheuser-Busch company.  When Busch's salesmen went to taverns to sell Busch's products, Busch sent them with logoed items like corkscrews and pocket knives, to give to their potential and current customers.\n\n1920's - The first bobblehead to be used for promotional purpose was one created for the New York Knicks.\n\n1936- The Chevrolet garage sent out a photographic postcard with their advertising message of 12 lube jobs for $6 in time payments.\n\n1937 - After polyurethane was first synthesized in response to the demand for a rubber substitute during World War II, stress relievers were developed.\n\nAfter 1930's - 2000's - Pens, coffee mugs, bumper stickers, post-its, etc became popular throughout the years.\n\n2008 - President Barack Obama created an online store with promotional SWAG - this was a different take on presidential election campaigning.\n\n2008 - Present - More and more products are available to print logos on than ever before.  With over 25,000 products to choose from and different kinds of inks used for print (example: UV Ink), the promotional products industry has evolved extensively in the United States alone, since the first promotional button was created for our first president."
0160_181cf8d2-940d-4be6-8530-be7a4fc27a20	"click to enlargesnowflock/ThinkstockGood reporting lets readers draw their own conclusions, and that's a good thing.After reading Aimee Levitt’s Reader cover story on rape at the University of Chicago, I sent her a note to say how much I admired it. What followed was an exchange of e-mails that exposed differences of perspective rooted in age and sex. I wondered if Aimee was beginning to think I actually didn't like her story much at all. But the story's greatest virtue was that it didn't tell me what I had to think about it. Some writers put their heads down, snort, and charge the reader. If ambiguity gets in their way they trample it out. Although rape invites didacticism, Aimee didn’t do that. Other writers love ambiguity so much they refuse to sully it by coming to any point at all. Aimee didn’t do that either. She empathized with her characters’ traumas and struggles but she allowed them to be complicated and inconsistent. In our e-mails we sounded like two people arguing over mutual friends whom they both feel they’ve come to understand better than the friends understand themselves.\nA journalist can’t afford to be an unreliable narrator, and Aimee’s reporting is meticulous. Yet she’s reticent. She gave me space. It’s the literary device of allowing the reader to write the story as he or she reads it. I saw this device at work a second time this week, in an essay in the Tribune. (It ran previously in the Washington Post.) ""I gave my daughter up for adoption. Then I tried to be her mom,"" is the title of the op-ed by Stephanie Andersen, a creative writing teacher in Pennsylvania who became pregnant at 16 and gave up the baby to a couple who couldn’t conceive. What we’re told: She stayed in touch with her daughter’s new parents, read their letters and studied their pictures. And when her daughter Eli was ten, Andersen welcomed her for a visit. These visits multiplied; when Andersen married, Eli was a junior bridesmaid. But when Andersen gave birth to a second daughter, Sophia, Eli’s disposition changed and she became sullen and angry. She announced she hated her family, and—Andersen tells us almost in passing—""after her mother moved out, she said she felt even more alone."" Eli actually moves in with Andersen when she turns 18. She enrolls in a local college, waits tables, and warms to Sophia. Andersen finally feels at peace. But it doesn’t last. Eli drops out of school and heads north to find her adoptive father. And now, Andersen admits to herself, ""I knew I would never be her mom, not in the way both of us hoped I could be. That chance, I understood now, had been lost 18 years ago."" She got to learn ""how to love her while simultaneously letting her go. Maybe that’s what motherhood is about after all.""\nOne way of responding to Andersen’s piece is to say she’s blind to her own material. But another way is to say she knows what she’s doing and she’s counting on readers to see past the story she says she’s telling to the ghastly story she hints at. Motherhood! an attentive reader is apt to think. This story isn't about motherhood. The real story here, the one we glimpse between the cracks, is about a little girl who grew up with two mothers who both abandoned her. She probably would have been better off if she’d never known her birth mother existed. Does Andersen understand that the boilerplate sentiments about motherhood she recites to wrap up her piece are vapid and off-point? Maybe not, but I want to think she does. As a final ironic flourish to a piece of ingenious creative writing they’re hard to top. I want to think that Andersen, like Aimee Levitt, knows her stuff and trusts her readers to find what's there."
0161_8873d7bc-4af4-4493-a772-ab2b5584f4e1	Gossip by Clara Grace Walker is a bit of a one-size-fits-all novel with something for everyone - a gripping murder mystery, some raunchy sex scenes, an awww-inspiring romance and the usual glitzy A-lister adventures and misadventures often encountered in summery chicklit. The book starts with a darker side. Newshound Nick Beck chases off to a murder scene at the local golf club, hoping for an exciting new story to cover, only to discover that the victim is his wife. There is some poetic justice here but I felt some empathy for him because, while he is happy to dish the dirt on the rich and famous in his celeb-filled tabloid, he does also have a more highbrow news publication so he seems slightly less ruthless and opportunistic than his purely scandal-seeking rival, Peter Arnold. With a seedy porn studio and its lowlife employees, a string of used and abused starlets and endless acrimonious divorces and extra-marital affairs popping up in the story, there are more suspects than you could shake a stick at !  It's a fun read with an engaging storyline and characters that you either love to love or love to hate. It reminded me of the atmosphere of Desperate Housewives and was perfect for devouring by the pool in Turkey. Gossip is one book from the Desire Never Dies trilogy, but it works perfectly as a stand-alone novel.

0162_c0a70550-50a5-4054-a954-cc88538a98c6	Here is some information on a few occasional invaders you may find in and around your home. Pesticides are not necessary to control any of them. \n\nSowbugs (Porcellionidae) and Pillbugs (Armadillidiidae) \n\nSowbugs and pillbugs, which are also called roly polys and woodlice, are crustaceans, not insects. They require a lot of moisture where they live. Sowbugs (Porcellio laevis) and pillbugs (Armadillium vulgare ) are actually beneficial as they are excellent decomposers. Pillbugs can roll up into a ball when threatened. Sowbugs cannot roll up into a ball. \n \nThey aren’t major pests, but will damage bean sprouts. They can be kept away from plants by putting food grade diatomaceous earth (DE) on the ground around the base of the plants. You can keep them out of your house by installing door sweeps if your doors don’t close tightly. \n\nScale insects (Coccidae) \n\nFemale scale insects are oval in shape and usually convex, but some species are flat. They have a hard cuticle that is either smooth or covered with a wax-like material. Most scale insects feed on plants and some are serious pests of crops. They are not a major pest in home gardens, but there is one species that is very common on houseplants. The brown soft scale (Coccus hesperidum) is found in houseplants all over the world. It will feed on a variety of flowering plants and ornamental foliage but is particularly fond of ferns. \n\nBecause of their scale-like body wall, they can be difficult to treat. If you have plants that are heavily infested, it would be best to discard them. You can remove them individually from plants by swabbing them with a mixture of alcohol and water or dish soap and water. \n\nSnails (Helicidae) and Slugs (Limacidae) \n\nSnails and slugs are terrestrial mollusks. Snails have shells while slugs do not. There are a great many species, but only a few are pests in gardens. They will feed on a wide variety of plants and are most active at night or after rains. They often leave large, jagged holes in the leaves of plants they are feeding on. \n\nThe best method of control is to put DE under and around all plants you want to protect as they will not crawl over it. You can also trap them with small pans of beer in the yard. The good news is the beer will also attract and kill any cockroaches in the yard. Never use a commercial snail bait that contains methaldehyde as this is very dangerous to dogs. \n\nSpringtails (Collembola) \n\nSpringtails are very small, wingless insects. Some are brown or gray, while other are brightly colored. They have a structure (furcula) on their underside that enables them to jump when suddenly straightened out. \n \nSpringtails are probably the most abundant non-social insect on the planet. There are approximately 650 species in the United States alone and they are found in the Arctic and Antarctic. \n\nThey can be very common in damp, organic soil where they feed on fungus. Large numbers in any area will show that the soil is healthy. They rarely cause any damage to plants, but will occasionally feed on young shoots. \n\nContrary to what some people believe, springtails are not capable of infesting human beings. This is a myth that is often found on the Internet. \n\nYou can control them by mixing DE with the soil they are in. In houseplants it would be a good idea to dry the soil out to eliminate any mold or fungi that they may be feeding on. If you have them in your home, you can spray them with a mixture of soap, water and alcohol. Mix a sprayer with equal amounts of water and alcohol and add a couple of tablespoons of dish soap. \n\nIf you have any pest questions, you can contact me at askthebugman2013@gmail.com or call me at 385-2820.

Twenty-two years later, the transgender community of Ireland celebrates a major victory. \n \nIn May 2015, Ireland became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage through popular vote. Two months later, Ireland made history yet again by becoming the fifth nation worldwide to legally recognize a transgender individual’s self-identified gender without medical or government intervention. \n \nIreland now joins the ranks of Denmark, Malta, Argentina and Columbia. \n \nThe term transgender refers to an individual who identifies as a gender different from their biological sex. Laverne Cox, Chaz Bono, Ruby Rose and Caitlyn Jenner are all examples of high-profile transgender individuals. \n \nIn many European countries, transgender people are required to receive sex-reassignment surgery, a diagnosis of mental disorder, a divorce if married or even sterilization before receiving legal recognition of their gender identity. \n \n“Transitioning is a complicated process,” said Assistant Professor of Psychology Sarah Estow. “Individuals choose to do so in many different ways.  There is often an overemphasis on and, sadly, a lurid curiosity about the state of a trans person’s genitals, completely missing the complexity of what it means to be trans.” \n \nMany feel setting requirements for legal recognition is harmful to how transgender people who desire to transition differently, or not at all, are treated and perceived. \n \nThis bill, however, allows individuals above the age 18 to receive this recognition without any such intervention or requirements, putting transgender individuals in control of the definition and determination of their own gender identities. \n \nCritics of this bill point out that there is currently no option other than male or female, which they feel excludes intersex and non-binary-identifying individuals, a large part of the transgender community, from legal recognition. \n \n“With any kinds of moments that appear as unmitigated wins, we have to be conscious of the message we are sending,” said Parker Hurley, LGBTQQA coordinator. “What this is saying is that it’s okay to be trans, so long as you are a certain type of trans.” \n \nGroups such as the Transgender Equality Network Ireland are currently lobbying for the inclusion of these identities. \n \nIn America, transgender individuals still face many barriers to receiving legal recognition. Most states require sex-reassignment surgery to alter one’s sex on their birth certificate, with Idaho, Kansas, Ohio and Tennessee refusing to alter these documents altogether. \n \nAdditionally, these legal processes and medical procedures are extremely costly and often inaccessible to transgender individuals. \n \n“These barriers cause a lot of issues for those who don’t have the money or don’t have the desire to physically transition but still identify as transgender,” said sophomore Aron Correa. \n \nIn America especially, transgender individuals face not only discrimination and lack of legal recognition, but also extreme cases of violence. \n \nAccording to a report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, out of all of the instances of reported homicide against LGBTQ individuals in 2013, 72 percent were transgender women, 67 percent of which were transgender women of color. \n \nAdditionally, in 2014, the Williams Institute published a report stating that 42 to 46 percent of transgender individuals have attempted suicide, compared to a rate of 4.6 percent for the overall population. \n \nIreland has taken the first step in combating this violence and self-harm, and their demonstration of solidarity could go a long way. \n \n“Having an entire country support the trans community in such a large way is really helpful,” said junior and trans student activist Taylor Brown. “It gives hope to trans kids everywhere who want to go throuh the whole process of transition.” \n\n     \n\nTags: #transgender , discrimination , Ireland , rights , same-sex marriage \n\n\nLeave a Comment      \nName (required) \n\n \nEmail Address (required) \n\n \nWebsite \n\n  \nSpeak your mind

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \n\nThe same day Texas police announced that a teenager falsely suspected of making a bomb would not be charged, President Barack Obama invited the student to the White House. \n\n""Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great,"" the POTUS Twitter account tweeted. \n\nAhmed Mohamed, who plans to become an engineer, went to his high school in Irving, Texas, on Monday with the goal of showing his teacher a digital clock he'd made from a pencil case. \n\nBut the 14-year-old's day did not end with high praise. Instead, an English teacher reported Ahmed's project, which prompted school officials to call police. A photo shows Ahmed being led out of school in handcuffs and a NASA T-shirt. \n\n""They arrested me and they told me that I committed the crime of a hoax bomb, a fake bomb,"" the freshman later explained. \n\nMohamed repeatedly told police that what they believed to be a bomb was actually a clock. He said they would not allow him to contact his father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, who ran for president of Sudan earlier this year. \n\n""My son is a very brilliant boy,"" the father told CNN. ""We need people like him in this country."" \n\nU.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan agreed. \n\n""We need to be encouraging young engineers, not putting them in handcuffs. #IStandWithAhmed,"" Duncan tweeted. \n\nThe White House invited Ahmed to Astronomy Night in October, an annual event that brings together astronauts, scientists and other professionals. \n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the incident ""is a good illustration of how pernicious stereotypes can prevent even goodhearted people who have dedicated their lives to educating young people from doing the good work they set out to do. \n\n""The president, like many of us, was struck by the news reports of this particular incident. The fact is, America's best teachers and our schools and our best schools, at least, nurture the intellectual curiously of all of our students. And this instance, it's clear that at least some of Ahmed's teachers failed him,"" Earnest said. \n\nPolice announced Wednesday that the teen will not be charged, but Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed said he is not sure if his son will return to school Thursday. School officials said they were cooperating with authorities on the matter. \n\n""We always ask our students and staff to immediately report if they observe any suspicious items and/or suspicious behavior,"" the school's statement reads. ""If something is out of the ordinary, the information should be reported immediately to a school administrator and/or the police so it can be addressed right away. We will always take necessary precautions to protect our students and keep our school community as safe as possible."" \n\nIn the meantime, Ahmed was racking up invitations from top tech companies. Google invited him on Twitter to this weekend's Google Science Fair. \n\nAnd Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg invited the teen to stop by his company in a statement posted on his page. \n\n""Having the skill and ambition to build something cool should lead to applause, not arrest. The future belongs to people like Ahmed. \n\n""Ahmed, if you ever want to come by Facebook, I'd love to meet you. Keep building,"" Zuckerberg wrote."

0166_555c7cb1-b2b5-45c5-a729-de91603153b0	Lock your car. Take your keys. These are the words taught to us as we were learning to drive and be responsible car owners. Of course it should go without saying to never drink and drive. But that is a subject that I will leave to others better equipped to delve into that arena. The lock your car and take your keys arena is where I want to drive your attention today. \n\nOf course I lock my car. I would be devastated if someone got into my car and took my four dollars and seventeen cents worth of loose change I throw in the console between the two front seats in case I have a need to get a soda at the nearest drive through. I call that change my Pepsi money. Even though I like Coke-a-Cola, it just sounds better to say Pepsi money than Coke money! And it would be a loss for sure if that same bad guy took my back up roll of fruit flavored life savers that I have had since Regan was in office—the governor’s office. \n\nOkay so I don’t have a ton of valuables in my car. But I also don’t want my car to be driven off to some greasy chop shop and be cut apart and sold by Marlon Brando wannabes ready to offer you a deal you can’t refuse! So I lock my car to keep her and her cargo safe from sticky fingers. \n\nBut that second set of words. Take your keys. Now-a-days I seem to have a problem, and apparently I am not alone. If you are new to me, you should know that I own a devil car. Yes the little devil is way smarter than yours truly. I take no pride in that fact, but I am a realist and know my limitations. \n\nThat knowing your limitations thing is one very important life lesson to learn. I remember finally realizing it when I was asked to climb a very step muddy hill on a Honda 110. Suffice to say I now know I have limitations and I use that life knowledge nearly every day! But again I have slipped off the trail… \n\nSo just how smart is my car? Well it doesn’t need keys. Nope, some rocket scientist, okay a car scientist, at a car manufacturing plant in some far east country, (hint, hint) decided to create a car that can tell if you have your key fob thingy on your person or in your purse, and without a real key looking type of key you can lock, unlock, start and turn off your car by pushing various buttons. Well I had to have that! It was so cool when the salesman was going over all the do dahs of the car when we bought it. Oh we bought it all right, we bought it all. Silly us! \n \nSkip forward a year… I now carry the key thingy in my pocket, luckily I wear jeans everywhere. I parked at a Costco to do some light shopping. Wait, light shopping and Costco? Again, silly me. Anyway I parked and my other half and I got out of the car. To lock our devil car you just need to push a little square black spot on one of the front door handles and the car politely say, “Beep,” from somewhere around its rear end. (Well that sounds unladylike.) \n\nSo I touched the magic spot and my devil car said, “Beep, beep, beep.” Wait? What? Three beeps. Well I thought I was hearing things. So as any woman would, I touched the magic spot again. Beep, beep, beep. Okay now I’m getting hot and I want to get to the muffins in Costco before they run out. I touched it again, of course. Beep, beep, beep. All this time the husband is just waiting, looking at me as though I were crazy. I am not! He of course can’t hear the beeping anyway. \n\nMust be door ajar. I go around and open, close and check each door. Didn’t seem any were askew. So of course I touched the magic spot again. Beep, beep, beep. Well what the? \n\nThe key fob thingy is in my pocket, yes I checked. So I went back to the beginning. I opened the driver’s door and got in. I closed the door and took a deep breath and noticed the air conditioner was cooling me. Nice. And the radio was on. Tuned to the 60’s.

I love the atmosphere that this place brings, that South Sudanese people bring to basketball."" \n\nSavannah Pride was formed almost a decade ago by 30-year-old South Sudanese refugee Mayor Chagai after he arrived in Australia from war-torn Sudan. \n\n""What it is about is the love for the game, it is also the other aspect of it is the social part of it and education,"" he said. \n\n""It's not just only about basketball. It's also engagement and social inclusion for these young kids and the fun of playing basketball."" \n\nHe said most of the boys are children of parents who fled Sudan before South Sudan officially gained independence in 2011. \n\n""Most of their parents fled south and they settled here in Australia or some kids come here with their uncles, aunties and the mother or the father they all remain in South Sudan and that's always a challenge as well because they miss their family,"" Mr Chagai said. \n  \nMr Gak said teenagers from the South Sudanese community are attracted to basketball because they have ""natural skills"". \n\n""We're long and tall. We can run pretty fast, jump pretty high so I think we've like found out that we're pretty good at it and everyone likes it."" \n\nWhile Savannah Pride was one of the first teams of its kind, teams are now starting up across Australia. \n\nThe National South Sudanese Australian Basketball Association now has 1,000 teenagers involved. \n\nMr Chagai said he was incredibly proud of his protégés. \n\n""They're having a lot of opportunities here. There's a lot of opportunities for them in Australia compared to South Sudan where we all came from,"" he said. \n\n""It wouldn't be the same if these kids were in South Sudan or any part of Africa compared to the opportunities that they are having right now in the community, playing basketball, having an education which is one of the biggest opportunities. \n\n""So their dreams now are more positive."""

While such CMA categories as vocal duo, video and musical event have often featured non-hit artists and material, the entertainer, album and male and female vocalist categories are all populated with at least one artist who hasn't had a top 10 single during the eligibility period, including Kacey Musgraves , Chris Stapleton ,  Garth Brooks and Lee Ann Womack . Granted, three of those acts reached No. 1 or No. 2 on the Top Country Albums chart, and all have had hits as an artist or songwriter in the past. Still, it suggests CMA voters are taking the time to look beyond radio playlists to judge what's working, creatively and/or financially, in the format. \n \nChris Stapleton Travels Back Up the Charts; Thomas Rhett Scores Again at Country Radio \n \nDierks Bentley is expanding his Whiskey Row restaurant and bar : A new franchise opens Sept. 17 in Tempe, Ariz., less than 7 miles from the first Row locale in Scottsdale.

0172_fd8d5661-f6f5-48a9-975f-8243b6e1ffd2	10:50 am Washington: Reflecting their dramatically expanded political, economic and strategic cooperation, India and the US have announced a new Diplomacy Partnership aimed at more closely aligning their strategic perspectives, diplomatic training, and engagements around the world.\n\nThe new partnership was announced at the conclusion of the first US-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue co-chaired by Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and US Secretary of State John Kerry. The Diplomacy Partnership between the US State Department of and the Indian Ministry of External Affairs includes a new Policy Planning Dialogue to share perspectives on strategic challenges and opportunities. The Diplomacy Partnership also will familiarise the two sides’ diplomatic corps with each other through site visits by institute staff and diplomats, and by the exchange of best practices in diplomatic training. As part of the Diplomacy Partnership, the US and India will strengthen and expand their consultations on the full range of regional and functional diplomatic issues. A fact sheet issued after the dialogue also noted that ten years ago, defence trade between the US and India was virtually non-existent.\n\nOver the last few years, the US has signed more than $10 billion in defence sales to India. These capabilities have strengthened India’s role as a net provider of security in the Indian Ocean Region, it said. US and Indian businesses have partnered on the co-development of defence equipment, establishing a base from which to launch new Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) co-development and co-production efforts in the future and expand the Indian defence industrial base.\n\nA renewed 10-year Defence Framework signed in June 2015 provides avenues for high level strategic discussions, continued exchanges between armed forces of both countries, and strengthening capabilities. The fact sheet noted that to-way trade has increased nearly three-fold from $36 billion in 2005 to $104 billion in 2014. Similarly, US investments in India have increased from a total FDI stock of $7.7 billion in 2004 to $28 billion today. Travel for tourism, business, and education has seen unprecedented growth: a 152 percent increase in overall visa applications for Indians wishing to travel to the US, reaching a total of over one million applications in FY 2015.\n\nVisa applications for Indian students have increased by 202 percent to 92,156 in FY 2015. US visitors to India have nearly doubled from 611,165 visitors in 2005 to 1,123,444 in 2015. Indian students account for the second-largest group of foreign students in the US, with approximately 102,673 students studying in the US in 2013-14. At the same time, more than a million Americans travelled to India in 2013, and more than 4,000 Indians applied for student visas at US diplomatic facilities in India on a single day in May 2015.\n\nThe Indian diaspora, the fact sheet noted, has made enormous contributions to every facet of American society. It has contributed “its talents and ingenuity at the tech start-ups of Silicon Valley, the lecture halls and labs of premier educational institutions, the board rooms of Fortune 500 companies, and the corridors of Washington and across the nation.”\n\nShare this Post: « Previous Article

On a much cooler fall day, I would likely reach for a chic loafer or a pointed-toe flat. My grey cardigan (Banana Republic option) has been such a useful piece in my wardrobe. I got this particular style at Loft about five years ago, and it's still in perfect condition. I've worn it so much too. Remember this navy and grey ensemble? That's one of my favorite color combinations. I've also worn it with dresses. Remember how the cardigan helped ready this shift dress for fall?

Want to see how it'll look later? Check out these two posts from last fall shot at the same location: Sweatshirt Style and Sweater Style. I've been shopping for a new tote for about a month.

I loved the more low-key look of the Madewell tote, but it was just too large for me.

0175_0968846d-7a55-4908-b897-48d1208fa396	NEW YORK — Bernie Sanders brought a “Feel the Bern” coffee cup for Stephen Colbert along with his message of lifting the middle class, and in return received a rock star’s welcome from the studio audience as a guest on CBS’ “The Late how” Frida. \n\n\n\t\tThe Vermont senator and Democratic presidential hopeful also brought along statistics to support his cause. \n\n\n\t\t“It is a moral outrage that the top one-tenth of 1 percent today owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent; that 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent,” he sid. \n \n\n\t\tTo that, as with nearly everything he said, the audience cheered. \n\n \n\n\n\t\tBut Colbert asked him how he expected to go all the way to the White House without forming a Super PAC and soliciting campaign contributions from big donors. \n\n\n\t\t“You don’t bring a spoon to a knife fight,” Colbertsaid. \n\n\n\t\tSanders countered he was getting small donations from hundreds of thousands of individual contributors instead. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\t\tSanders laughed. \n\n\n\t\t“I prefer the term ‘progressive,”’ he declared.
0176_10db0fad-9eb1-4255-9a5a-f709a102c60c	On a night when newcomers made their presence known for a short-handed Lincoln Southwest volleyball team, experienced seniors stepped forward when the Silver Hawks needed it most. \n\nSenior Maddie Kelle had four kills in the fifth set and senior outside hitter Brenna Hansen registered a key ace block and served an ace on back-to-back points to lift the Class A No. 6 Hawks to a 25-16, 21-25, 26-24, 12-25, 15-13 home triumph over No. 9 Lincoln North Star in the season opener for both teams Thursday night. \n\nAfter North Star battled from an 8-3 deficit to take a 13-12 lead, Hansen’s block tied the fifth set at 13, then her ace serve put Southwest at match point. After a long rally, senior setter Hailey Bax ended it with a dump shot that the Navigators couldn’t cover. \n\nBax had six of her 18 assists in the final set. \n\nThe victory becomes even more significant considering Southwest was without its two senior all-state players, both of whom are Division I college recruits. Allie Davis, a 6-foot-2 Wichita State outside hitter recruit, is still a couple of weeks away from returning to the lineup after two offseason wrist surgeries. \n\nSenior libero and Northern Colorado recruit Taylor Els is out for two weeks because of disciplinary reasons. \n\n“This win shows what kind of program we have,” said Hansen, a 5-10 outside hitter who led a balanced Southwest attack with 10 kills, two ace blocks and three ace serves. \n\nTwo freshmen played key roles for Southwest — 5-10 outside hitter Jaden Ferguson who finished with 10 kills and three blocks, and 6-foot Hannah Kelle, Maddie’s younger sister. Sophomore libero Kaitlin Siefkes had 28 digs in place of Els. Setter/right side Rachel Walker, a sophomore transfer from Auburn, had 23 assists and seven kills in her first Class A match. \n \n“It was fun to see all the new players come out and kill it like they did,” said Maddie Kelle, who had 10 kills and three ace blocks. “I know they were all nervous before the match, but once they got out there and settled in, they did great.” \n\nNorth Star dominated the fourth set, then battled back from the early five-point deficit in the fifth to take its 13-12 advantage on a Southwest hitting error. \n\nSuper-State senior middle blocker Sarah Allick paced the Navigators with a match-high 14 kills and three ace blocks. Ashley Kistaitis added 10 kills, while Jenna Tederman and Haley Seip added eight kills each.
0177_c4ef356f-c8fe-49e9-bd48-82242914d009	Share This Tags Business News of Tuesday, 15 September 2015 Source: Graphic.com.gh 2015-09-15 File photo The Programme Leader of GhanaVeg, Mr Joep van den Broek, has said the country could become self-sufficient in vegetable production when the public works with the private sector as stakeholders for a year-round irrigated production. He said it would be a win-win for both sides when the public sector developed infrastructure and attracted the private sector to come in with other logistics and infrastructure within the value chain. “Ultimately, a lot of opportunities for Ghana lie in irrigated production throughout the country, from the south, the middle belt and the north. The country is nestled around water bodies but with very little irrigation. With irrigation, you can do off-season production and meet local demand and stop the importation of onions, tomatoes and other vegetables. Speaking to the Daily Graphic at the 9th GhanaVeg Business Platform in Accra, the programme leader said the country had a perfect climate for the production of vegetables such as onions, chillies and tomatoes, and that coupled with the abundance of water, the country had all going for it to become a major player in the production of vegetables. A Dutch trade mission, comprising leading vegetable sector companies, was in the country to explore market and investment opportunities. GhanaVeg, which created the platform to bring players in the industry together to touch base on trends and developments, is a four-year strategic response (2014-2017) by the Netherlands to develop a sustainable and internationally competitive vegetable sector in the country to contribute to inclusive economic growth. It is a bilateral support by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands committed to developing and promoting commercial vegetables sector in the country. Selecting a sector to support was research-based which proved the country’s vast potential. There are enormous market opportunities across the world for vegetables, with the Netherlands alone holding about 14 billion euros in value. In 2013 for instance, it imported 4.6 billion euros worth of fresh fruits and vegetables from 107 countries and exported 7.1 billion to 150 countries. Ghana, where the need to consume more vegetable is catching on with the population imports various vegetables from the Netherlands and neighboring countries such as Burkina Faso, Mali and La Cote d’Ivoire. Mr Broek cited VegPro as a good example of how the government, under the Millennium Challenge Account grant, developed an irrigation project at Kpong at the Left Bank of Akuse Kpong Piped Irrigation Water Supply (KPIWS) Project for VegPro Ghana Limited. A member of the trade mission, Bejo Seeds, visited a carrot farm at Mampong which produces 10 tons. But the seeds company representatives believed that with their intervention and further linkages with other solutions providers in the Netherlands, the company should be able to easily scale up yields to 40 tons. The companies in the mission also included Unitherm, a cold chain provider; mechanisation equipment providers, Kramer and Matrex, and was led by Mr Peter Verbaas, the director of the Dutch fruit and vegetables wholesale association, FrugiVenta. GhanaVeg also presented findings on its private extension service study, which examined the three options of working with input suppliers to provide extension support to farmers. These involved forming study clubs of farmers who share experience, knowledge and ideas and solve common challenges together, and a third option of using more consultancy services delivered by experts with vegetables as their specialisation. “We see great prospects in the third option. There are already a number of good agricultural consultancy companies in Ghana who are active in all kinds of sectors, including fruits and vegetables. What we would like to do with them is to see how they can expand their scope to training small scale farmers, groups of farmers and outgrower schemes with the latest state-of-the-art knowledge in vegetable production,” Mr Broek explained. Working with smallholder farmers is a major requirement within GhanaVeg’s mandate, which is aimed at encouraging inclusive development.

0179_d5871f4a-a7a3-4c6c-99e2-7fc59484cde7	In May, the discovery of a young woman’s body packed into a suitcase buried under cement in the hills in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province, left South Korea in shock and horror. \n \nThe 26-year-old, surnamed Kim, was murdered by her 24-year-old boyfriend, who allegedly killed her while drunk after she tried to break up with him. The boyfriend, only identified by his surname Lee, impersonated Kim on social media for two weeks after killing her and disposing of her body. \n \nAccording to Rep. Jeong Yong-ki of the ruling Saenuri Party, the number of murder cases among dating partners has been on the rise in Korea since 2012, from 99 to 108 last year. In the last three years, the number of victims like Kim totaled 313. \n \n       A research also showed that 40 percent of the Korean women who experienced dating abuse for the first time chose to stay in the relationship, despite the possibility of continuing violence. (123RF)     \nThe murder cases accounted for 11.9 percent of all crimes committed by the victims’ romantic partners against them, including stalking, physical violence and rape. The rate is particularly high considering the total number of murder cases in Korea only accounted for 1.69 percent of all violent crimes — murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault — in the same period. \n \n“This means two people are being killed by their romantic partners every week,” Rep. Jeong said. \n \nAccording to Korea Women’s Hotline, a nongovernmental organization helping female victims of violence, at least 114 Korean women were killed by either their husbands or boyfriends last year, while at least 95 women survived after being seriously attacked by their spouses or romantic partners. \n \nAlmost 90 percent of women who participated in the NGO’s research last year said they had been either physically or emotionally abused while dating or during courtship. From 2011 to 2013, some 20,500 individuals were arrested for dating violence. \n \nAccording to the police, Kim had also reportedly endured serious dating violence for about a year until she tried to end things with Lee. \n \nAccording to local news reports, Lee would often break into Kim’s house without consent for “not picking up his calls” and physically abuse her. Lee later confessed to the police that he killed Kim “in a fit of rage” when he learned that Kim wanted to break up with him. \n \nKim and Lee had met as teacher and student at a private English institution in Busan, where Kim had been teaching upon returning to Korea after graduating from the State University of New York at Albany. \n \nKim’s story overlaps with experiences of many women who participated in researcher Lee Hwa-young’s study for Korea Women’s Hotline. \n \nMany suffered abuse, assault and rape when they tried to end the relationship. \n \nOne of the victims had been dragged to a motel room against her will and raped there by her enraged boyfriend, right after she told him that she wanted to break up with him. \n \nAnother victim had been guilt-tripped and emotionally abused after she tried to end things with her boyfriend. “He told me that I’m being a terrible person (by trying to break up with him) to his mother as well, because he already told her that we are getting married and our breakup is going to hurt and disappoint her badly,” the victim told researcher Lee in her study. \n \nAnother victim was stunned by what a police officer told her after she reported her ex. She also had been stalked and physically abused by her ex after breaking up with him. The officer reportedly told her: “You shouldn’t have been so harsh when you broke up with him.” \n \nAccording to Safe Harbors of the Finger Lakes, an American support organization for victims of violence, there are some characteristics that are common to abusers of dating violence. One of them has to do with gender role expectations. \n \nMany individuals who abuse their romantic partners tend to have certain ideas of how men and women should act, largely following the stereotypical ideas of male dominance and female passivity. \n \nThe abusers also may have difficulty expressing feelings, abuse alcohol and be “protective of their romantic partners to the point of controlling that person,” according to the organization. \n \nLocal experts say that popular culture and sex education are some of the biggest — and often negative — influences in gender role expectations among Koreans, which sometimes cause problematic consequences in relationships. \n \n“For example, there are so many Korean TV dramas that show its male protagonist forcing a kiss onto his love interest, while the woman just docilely accepts it,” researcher Lee from Korea Women’s Hotline told The Korea Herald. \n \n“Many men, especially teenagers, may think this is normal and acceptable behavior. It does not only apply to men. While men may think it’s acceptable to kiss or touch someone against the person’s will — or it’s not ‘manly enough’ or ‘cool’ to even ask the woman for consent — young women may think they should just remain silent even if their dating partner does something they don’t want or like, or keep their wants to themselves and wait until the man makes the move.” \n \nMeanwhile, the Education Ministry’s recently issued – and heavily criticized – guidelines for sex education famously stated that “date rape can occur in situations where a man spends a lot of money on dates, as it is natural for him to want commensurate compensation from the woman.” \n \nLee’s research also showed that 40 percent of the women who experienced dating abuse for the first time chose to stay in the relationship, despite the possibility of continuing violence. The largest portion of them, 60 percent, said it was because the abuse was not “serious enough” to end the relationship. \n \nRep. Jeong said the government needs to be more involved in combating dating and domestic violence. Introducing heavier penalties for stalking, which often leads to more serious forms of abuse, can be one of the ways to improve the situation, according to civic experts. In Korea, the heaviest penalty a stalker can face is a fine of 100,000 won ($83). \n \nSince 2012, two bills have been proposed to introduce heavier punishment for stalking, but are still pending at the National Assembly for approval. \n \nBy Claire Lee ( dyc@heraldcorp.com )

Parrish; Thomas & Mercer (382 pages, $15.95) \n\n--- \n\nIdentity issues are among the driving force of the mystery genre as characters grapple with who they are and how events shape their persona. In P.J. Parrish's captivating ""She's Not There,"" a young woman wrestles not only with her identity - in this case exacerbated by temporary amnesia - but also tries to find the very essence of who she is. ""She's Not There"" also works as a story about a marriage. \n\nAmelia wakes up in a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., hospital with no idea who she is or how she became battered and bruised. A stranger apparently found her by the side of the road and brought her to the hospital, her purse and keys missing. Slowly, her first name comes back to her as does her last name, Tobias, and the police track down her husband, Alex, who had not seen his wife in four days. But Alex's visit at the hospital leaves Amelia with an uneasy feeling so she flees the hospital. She is afraid of Alex, yet not sure why. \n\nThe worried Alex hires Clay Buchanan, a skip tracer who commands a high fee. ""I do one thing and one thing only. I find people who don't want to be found."" But Clay makes it clear that if Amelia has reason to be afraid, he will not tell Alex where she is. Clay's investigation takes him across the country and back to Fort Lauderdale. As Amelia slowly regains her memory, she can only rely on her instincts, which may be flawed. \n\nParrish, the pseudonym of sisters Kelly Nichols of Michigan and Kristy Montee of Fort Lauderdale, delivers a tension-filled plot rich in characterizations. Twists and turns keep the reader off-kilter. Bits and pieces of Amelia's background, and how she ended up in the hospital, are doled out, adding to the suspense, as do the snippets revealed about Clay. \n\nA sequel is required."
0181_30b981c4-8e8d-4468-b240-710f0ad82dac	07:49 PM September 9th, 2015 \n\nRecommended \n\n“It has been more than a decade and while he and everyone else have moved on, I am still standing here—alone, waiting.” \n\nThis month, fourteen years ago. \n\nIt was when he and I officially ended. It will take me a year and many more months before I can stop denying that truth to myself. But it was over then, nonetheless. Unlike the many breakups we had, that very last time, he didn’t go after me, didn’t ask me back, didn’t try to win me over. \n\nThat heartbreak led me to leave our hometown, my family, my comfort zone, and everything and everyone I knew and grew up with and start somewhere anew. It was difficult, scary and painful. Many times did I want to just pack my bags and go back home but didn’t. \n\nI still wonder how I could have stayed away for so long. But I was determined to do it not only because I needed to save face, but also because I knew I couldn’t be in the same vicinity and not pine for him. \n\nOnly God knows how many times I have driven by his house or plans I orchestrated to make sure I’d bump into or get a glimpse of him, or even how I slept with the phone right beside me to make sure I won’t ever miss a ring, a beep, a call, hoping it is him. \n\nLater I learned there was someone else. Unlike what he told me, the girl my friends had been seeing him with was not his sister. She was the girl he was about to marry two years later, have kids and build a happy home with. \n\nMany years after that day in July that sealed our fate, I managed to live my life far away and went on to have a great career, relationships, even marriage—in spite of the “closure” talk I felt I needed and never got. He too got promoted and became his company’s big boss. I moved on because I needed it to function. He moved on too—and in a big way. \n\nHis wife’s work eventually made him move overseas, while circumstances led me back home after a decade. As I write this, I’m at the airport waiting for my flight and thinking about him and me and the nonexistent us. \n\nI heard he was flying in with his wife and kids to our hometown for a vacation. By sheer coincidence, I was flying out the same day, today, for work and vacation too. It had been days since I knew and I couldn’t keep still since. I have been preoccupied with thoughts of his return—at work, while driving, when I wake up, and before I retire at night. Like my crying bouts 14 years ago, this happens anywhere and everywhere. \n\nFunny how fate works, him flying in the same day I am flying out. I wonder if it is the universe setting us up to coincidentally bump into each other or conspiring to keep us apart—like it has done in the past 14 years. \n\nGod knows I don’t know what I’ll do when I see him. With him, I don’t trust myself enough to do what is right. \n\nIt has been more than a decade and while he and everyone else have moved on, I am still standing here. Alone. Waiting, still waiting, for I don’t know what. A closure talk, perhaps? A proper ending to our love story? \n\nBelieve me, I’m a sensible girl. If a friend is in a same predicament as I am and has asked for my advice, I will say, leave, let it be. Don’t wait for a closure that may never happen and just believe that things end for a reason. \n\nBut like a doctor who can’t heal his own wounds, I can’t too. I’m messed up, like I was 14 years ago. Better now, maybe, but still messed up. \n\nNo matter how impossible it may seem, I still pray for that day to come—that he’ll help me close this chapter of my life, the way he has done with his. At the very least, please, please, let me have that. \n\nElle Miller, 33, is back at her hometown down south and dabbles in a career as a wordsmith. \n\nPREVIOUS ENTRIES \n\nLove.Life. is an online weekly column of contributed personal essays sharing real-life stories about love, relationships, sex, and yes, tadhana.

0183_4bbbcd17-6203-43fa-96a5-f43dad18c888	LOUISVILLE, Ky.: A Kentucky clerk who went to jail for defying a federal court’s orders to issue same-sex marriage licenses says she met briefly with the pope during his historic visit to the United States. \n\nThe Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, didn’t deny the encounter took place but said Wednesday in Rome that he had no comment on the topic. \n\nRowan County clerk Kim Davis and her husband met privately with Pope Francis on Thursday afternoon at the Vatican Embassy in Washington, D.C., for less than 15 minutes, said her lawyer, Mat Staver. \n\n“It was really very humbling to even think that he would want to meet me or know me,” Davis said in an interview with ABC. \n\nDavis, an Apostolic Christian, spent five days in jail earlier this month for defying a federal court order to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In a telephone interview late Tuesday, Staver would not say who initiated the meeting with the pope or how it came to be, though he did say that Vatican officials had inquired about Davis’ situation while she was in jail. He declined to name them. \n\n“He told me before he left, he said ‘stay strong.’ That was a great encouragement,” Davis said of the pope during the ABC interview. “Just knowing that the pope is on track with what we’re doing and agreeing, you know, it kind of validates everything.” \n\nShe didn’t say in the interview whether she had a private audience with the pope or she was part of larger crowd. \n\nDavis was in Washington for the Values Voter Summit, where the Family Research Council, which opposes same-sex marriage, presented her with an award for defying the federal judge. While in Washington, the longtime Democrat said she was switching to the Republican party because she felt abandoned by Democrats in her fight against same-sex marriage. \n\nPope Francis did not focus on the divisive debate over same-sex marriage during his visit last week. As he left the country, he told reporters who inquired that he did not know Davis’ case in detail, but he defended conscientious objection as a human right. \n\n“It is a right. And if a person does not allow others to be a conscientious objector, he denies a right,” Francis said.

She apparently head butted one of the cops — and the whole thing was caught on tape!  \nMiko Grimes , got herself into some major trouble prior to her NFL hubby’s football game! The wife of Miami Dolphins cornerback Brent Grimes  was arrested after being given several warnings from police outside of the Dolphins stadium on Sept. 27. Following her arrest, Miko is facing charges of disorderly conduct, battery on a police officer and resisting arrest with violence. Watch the intense video of her arrest below! \n \nDuring pre-game festivities, Miko was trying to cross a busy road and refused to listen to a cop’s demand to stop, which resulted in her arrest. Although she was the one not cooperating, Miko charged at an officer who then grabbed her in a bear-hug-like motion and brought her to the ground. \n \nAfter the officer contained Miko with her hands cuffed behind her back, she still continued to be aggressive towards the cops. A huge crowd formed around Miko as she screamed profanities at the officers, repeating the phrase, “Are you f*****g serious right now?” One of the observers caught part of the incident on tape! \n \n[embedded content] \n \nMiko must have really been upset, because she didn’t stop being combative toward officers. Before being taken to an off-site police station, Miko reportedly head-butted an officer — that certainly couldn’t have helped her situation! Her aggressiveness even resulted in minor injuries to her right knee and arm. \n \nTo make matters worse, Brent apparently didn’t know about Miko’s arrest until after the game, according to reports. Unfortunately, on top of her arrest, the Dolphins suffered a major loss to the Buffalo Bills by a score of 41-14. Hearing that his wife was arrested right after a tough loss couldn’t have made things any easier for Brent or Miko! Hopefully Miko will be able to let go of her anger and resolve things with the police soon! \n  \n— Taylor Weatherby

At last their dream of a ""beautiful life"" far from bombs seemed within reach. \n \nCradling four-month-old Adam, Ahmad and Alia from Baghdad could now relax in the plush evening train from Vienna , among businessmen, tourists and other refugees, amazed at their week-long odyssey from Turkey to Greece , then Macedonia, Serbia, Hungary and Austria. \n \nThe nightmare, they hoped, was behind them, an exhausting 2,500-kilometre (1,500-mile) journey, with an AFP team travelling along from the Greek-Macedonian border up to Germany, which many refugees see as a promised land. \n \n""We made it,"" smiled 27-year-old Ahmad, who sold his home and fashion store to take his wife and son out of harm's way. \n \nIn the past week, the hip young couple with Adam tucked in a baby sling had escaped arrest by border authorities, slept rough when no hotels would take them in, evaded thieves and haggled with greedy smugglers. \n \nIn the Balkan countries they had entered legally, they waited long hours under the scorching sun, then shivering at night, to register with local authorities. They were given practically no assistance amid a shocking dearth of government and international aid along the way. \n \nWith the AFP photo, text and video team in tow, the couple plodded north by train, bus, on foot, an exodus marred at every turn with the sense they were being exploited. \n \nIn and out of Hungary, they held their breath as they followed an Iraqi Kurdish smuggler through fields under the moonlight to avoid being fingerprinted and forcibly returned there in line with EU rules. \n \n- 'Live together or die together' - \n \nIn all they paid more than 9,000 euros ($10,000) to reach Germany. \n \n""I just want a beautiful life for myself, for my wife. I want to live like other people, without tension, without stress, without fear,"" said Ahmad, his big brown eyes sparkling. \n \nTheir decision to flee Iraq came in February last year, 10 days after their engagement, when Ahmad took his sweetheart for dinner at a restaurant called Mr Chicken. \n \n""There was an explosion and all the glass smashed in our faces,"" Ahmad said. The scars are still visible, notably on the strikingly pretty Alia who wears her auburn hair tied back in a little bun. \n \nThe daughter of an academic, her studies were stopped by the Islamist groups that emerged after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. \n \n""When I was in school, I was attacked by armed men who threatened to kill me because I wasn't wearing the hijab,"" said the 26-year-old dressed in a T-shirt, Levi's jeans and trainers with fuchsia-coloured laces. \n \nBut she kept looking forward. ""We hope at least some of our dreams will come true,"" Alia said, on a bus from Belgrade to Kanjiza near Hungary. \n \nAhmad first tried and failed to get asylum in the United States, so opted for an illegal route to Europe. Alia's parents did not want her to risk such a trip, but she felt she had no choice. \n \nAhmad, too, hesitated when he saw the rickety fishing boat their smuggler in Turkey was ordering them to climb into, wanting his wife and baby to turn back. \n \nBut Alia stood firm: ""Either we live together or we die together."" \n \nPangs of regret overtook her one morning in Budapest, however, when they couldn't find a hotel for lack of documents. Even a miserable brothel a smuggler tried to take them to was full. \n \n- Stress stopped mother's milk - \n \n""I can't tell my mother what we're going through, she would be too upset,"" Alia wept, her eyeshadow smudged after another sleepless night. \n \nNot only did traffickers take advantage, so too did vendors selling overpriced water, sandwiches and Red Bull -- the energy drink people on the trail guzzled to keep them going -- at every turn. \n \nIn Serbia's Presevo camp, hustlers sold fake permits to enable the migrants to skip a day-long queue. Police wore face masks and refused to answer any of the desperate migrants' pleas. \n \nIn a Belgrade cafe, Ahmad begged a smuggler to drive the family to Budapest. In a rare moment of kindness from a trafficker, the man of Algerian origin refused. \n \n""Haven't you heard about the 71 people found dead in the truck? I'm not taking anyone with babies,"" the smuggler said. \n \nWhen they finally made it to the Hungarian capital, the family was driven up by another smuggler to the border with Austria and told to walk to the other side. \n \nSix of their travel companions were arrested, but Ahmad and Alia escaped. Imagining his father was only playing, baby Adam giggled as Ahmad ran. \n \nIn mid-week, Alia could no longer nurse her baby. The stress of living like a fugitive had dried up her milk. ""Alia hasn't eaten so she can't breastfeed Adam,"" Ahmad said. ""I can't take seeing my son cry."" \n \n- 'Not a hotel' - \n \nBut there were also many beautiful moments. \n \n""The harder the journey gets, the stronger our relationship grows,"" said Alia. \n \nOnce in Vienna, the first city where the couple did not feel persecuted, they had to plan. All this time they had been running, without knowing where to. \n \nAfter much hesitation they settled on the German city of Cologne, where Ahmad's sister lives. They would decide later whether to stay there or continue to Holland where they both have family. \n \nAt the Vienna train station, the couple shared a kebab sandwich. They could almost taste the perfect ending they had dreamed of, in the arms and homes of relatives. \n \nBut in Munich where they were due to change trains, the journey came to a bittersweet stop. \n \nThere were no cheering crowds, only silence as they were detained by German police, taken to a makeshift facility for registration and then to a grim temporary shelter. \n \nAhmad kept up a brave face as he hugged and kissed his weeping wife. ""It's OK,"" he said. \n \nSpeaking to AFP from the camp through the phone app Viber, Ahmad for the first time sounded disillusioned. \n \n""It's really crowded here, we are two families in one tiny room and we are still wearing the same clothes we arrived in,"" he said. \n \nAlia tried to negotiate a better living space but an official snapped: ""This is not a hotel."" \n \nBecause of the large number of refugees and migrants arriving in Germany it could be months before the family has a place to call home. \n \n""I thought that we would be able to rest, however it seems we still have a long road ahead,"" Ahmad said, added: ""Thank God, at least we made it."" \n \nSource"

0188_bfc6a03f-a5a9-4342-b697-6ded1c302d58	"The Queen has thanked the nation for its kind messages on the day she becomes the longest reigning monarch in British history. \n\nReflecting on the landmark record, the Queen admitted it was not a milestone she had ever aspired to. \n\nAs she opened the £294 million Scottish Borders Railway in Tweedbank, the Queen said: ""Prince Philip and I are very grateful for the warmth of your welcome on this occasion. \n\n""Many ,including you First Minister, have also kindly noted another significance attaching to today although it is not one to which I have ever aspired. \n\n""Inevitably a long life can pass by many milestones. My own is no exception. But I thank you all and the many others at home and overseas for your touching messages of great kindness."" \n\nThe 89-year-old monarch, with the Duke of Edinburgh at her side, has spent the day travelling 40 miles on the railway with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, starting at Edinburgh's Waverley Station, stopping off at Newtongrange in Midlothian before carrying on to the Borders town of Tweedbank. \n\nLater today, the Queen overtakes the record set by her great-great grandmother Queen Victoria to become the nation's longest reigning sovereign, when she will have been on the throne for 23,226 days, 16 hours and approximately 30 minutes. \n\nThe Queen demonstrated her business as usual approach at the end of her short speech by remarking: "" So now to the business in hand. It is my very happy duty to declare the Borders Railway open."" \n\nThe milestone is tinged with sadness for the Queen as the calculation of the length of her reign is linked to the death of her father, King George VI, and that of Queen Victoria. \n\nThere was no mention of Victoria in the Queen's address but she was wearing her great-great grandmother's diamond bow brooch, which was handed down to her through the generations. \n\nThe Queen began her speech by remarking that she and Philip were delighted to be back in the Borders and to have arrived by train. \n\n""It's been wonderful to witness the excitement which the return of the railway has brought here,"" she said. \n\nEarlier she was greeted by delighted crowds at Edinburgh's Waverley Station as she stepped onto the polished steam locomotive Union of South Africa with Philip. \n\nThe Queen, the Duke and Ms Sturgeon travelled in a ''Pegasus'' Pullman coach that seats 14 in the main lounge area and also has a bar - that was serving tea and coffee. \n\nThe trio were seated in a pristine private compartment at the end of the coach's lounge area with the Queen's entourage in nearby seats. \n\nTributes have been paid to the monarch with Prime Minister David Cameron declaring in the House of Commons: ""The Queen is our Queen and we could not be more proud of her. \n\n""She has served this country with an unerring grace, dignity and decency and long may she continue to do so.'' \n\nMs Sturgeon in her own speech greeted the Queen with ''a simple but heartfelt thank you'' for her work. \n\nShe said: ''We are privileged ma'am that you have chosen to mark today's milestone here. All of us are delighted to be able to share some of this special day with you. For those watching from around the world let me say, on their behalf ma'am a simple but heartfelt thank you.'' \n\nThe rest of the royals carried on with their scheduled diary of engagements, with the Queen's daughter-in-law the Duchess of Cornwall describing the milestone as ""marvellous"" on a tour of the studios of ITV show This Morning. \n\nThe Queen's son the Duke of York, in a pre-recorded interview with the BBC, spoke of her consistency and leadership. \n\n''It's a milestone in UK terms but as far as her consistency and leadership - it's the normal run of the mill sort of date. It's just one day in her reign,"" he said. \n\n''So yes it's an extraordinary achievement in some respects, but actually it's about the consistency and the leadership that she is showing and has shown throughout her reign that I think is probably the one thing that marks her up more than anything else.'' \n\nThe exact moment the Queen passes Victoria's milestone is not known as there is no precise time for the death of her father who died in the early hours of February 6 1952. \n\nBut it is thought he probably died at 1am so at around 5.30pm the Queen will make history when she will have reigned for a few minutes longer than Victoria."
0189_bb1e4251-08be-490f-b11b-979cd703d4bb	Thanks to the Internet, cat iconography is ubiquitous and inescapable. However, this is just the continuation of an epic, millennia-strong love affair between two (not so) different species. \n\n10 The First ‘Pet’ Cat\nThe unearthing of a 9,500-year-old cat at a Neolithic burial site in Cyprus has quite possibly pushed back the anthro-felinic timeline by thousands of years. You see, cats are not native to the region and must have been brought there by ancient settlers.\n\nIt was first thought that humans transmogrified wild cats to house cats around 4,000 years ago in Egypt. However, more recent finds credit cat domestication to the Chinese 1,000 years earlier. Since then, older specimens have been found in Northern Africa, but the nearly 10,000-year-old remains unearthed at the Shillourokambos settlement in Cyprus are a downright antediluvian antique.\n\nThis Neolithic Nyan Cat was planted about a 0.3 meters (1 ft) away from its potential human, a person of great importance, judging by the intricate burial trinkets found within. The duo’s grave was littered with a rare assortment of items, including ornamental shells and a small, ceremonial jade axe.\n\nWhy was the kitten entombed alongside a human? Archaeologists aren’t sure, but the eight-month-old mouser definitely wasn’t butchered, strengthening the notion that the cat commanded at least a moderate amount of political sway.\n\n9) Native American Ritual Burial\nNobody knows when humans stopped seeing cats as simple rat-killing machines and adopted them as cuddly companions, but a recent archaeological find has provided a partial answer.\n\nAt a Native American burial mound in what is now western Illinois, archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old bobcat. We’ve already talked about an even older cat, so why is this one so special? For one, it’s a historical one-off and the only recorded burial of a bobcat across the entire annals of archaeology. On top of that, it was placed in the middle of 22 human carcasses. It was also found with a fancy shell-and-bear-teeth collar around its neck.\n\nSadly, we might never find out if the Hopewell Native Americans really did try to domesticate bobcats. The feline’s current repository, the Illinois State Museum, is facing financial distress and shutting down. Hopefully, a miraculous cash infusion will save the institution, because if the museum closes, the bones will be made inaccessible by heaps of bureaucratic stupidity.\n\n8) Tokyo’s Cat Temple\nThe Japanese really, really love their cats. In the 18th century, the maneki neko, little white cat effigies with upraised paws, were created to bring prosperity to shop owners and noodle weavers alike. Just like China’s opaque wall of smog, this endearing Japanese character has gradually swept through mainland Asia.\n\nBut when it comes to sheer numbers, no site houses more maneki neko than the legendary Gotokuji Temple in Tokyo’s Setagaya ward. The temple itself is small and unassuming, its facade giving no indication of the ceramic cat chaos within. Step inside, and you’ll see cloisters crowded with tiny white figures. Take a closer look, and you’ll find that they’re all cats!\n\nConsidered home by all maneki neko, Gotokuji Temple’s mythos is fascinating but perhaps not quite 100 percent historically established. Apocryphal or not, the story is as follows: Once upon a time, a wandering feudal lord sought shelter from a tempest underneath a tree not far from the temple. He noticed the priest’s cat beckoning him with its paw and followed it into the temple. Moments later, that same sheltering tree was vaporized by lightning. To honor the portentous pet, the feudal lord created the first maneki neko, beckoning paw and all. \n\n7) Houtong, The Village Saved By Its Cats\nSituated on Taiwan’s northern coast, the village of Houtong was literally saved by cats. It sounds like the plot of a Disney movie, but in the 1970s, this once-proud mining town was on the verge of disintegration, thanks to the emergence of cleaner energy sources, such as oil and gas.\n\nThe population had apocalyptically dwindled from 6,000 to a few hundred, and the little coal hub was in its death throes. Then in 2008, in a miracle that would be par for the course in Hollywood feel-good films, a random cat fan known Internet-wide as “Palin88” staged a photo op for the village’s large cat contingent.\n\nWith hundreds of cats lazing about the streets, Houtong immediately became an online sensation and suddenly needed a tourism board. Now, people are flocking from all corners of the globe to visit the slightly renamed Houtong Cat Village. They descend by the thousands on weekend jaunts to indulge their cat lust and inadvertently save a portion of Taiwanese mining history.\n\n6) Cats And Marriage Beliefs\nFor all their ferocity, would you believe that the Vikings loved cats? They stocked felines to keep home and ship rat-free, and the most renowned of these breeds, the hulking Norwegian forest cat, still thrives in Scandinavia and on Reddit.\n\nBecause of their connection to Freyja, the goddess of getting it on, felines gained mystical status, and the Vikings looked upon all cat-related events as predictors of a fruitful (or fitful) marriage. For example, gifting newlyweds a black cat was a surefire way to ensure wedded bliss for all their days. In contrast to our modern stereotype of the crazy cat lady, all feline-frenzied females were guaranteed to eventually tie the knot.\n\nInterestingly, many other peoples, including the French and English, adhered to the belief that felines doubled as matrimonial crystal balls. Seemingly random factors such as a mew or a sneeze could influence upcoming marriages. Half a Eurasian landmass away, the same beliefs propagated through the Buddhist world, where anything that meowed and had dark fur was considered a prognosticator of future riches. Polydactyl, or thumbed, cats were also considered lucky and fawned over.\n\n5) Kuching Cat Museum\nThe Kuching Cat Museum, in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, is the first institution of its kind and the world’s largest repository of all things feline. Kuching roughly means “Cat City,” and as such, no better place could exist to showcase historical artifacts alongside tacky cat curios from all corners of the globe. In total, over 2,000 pieces from disparate cultures and times are displayed.\n\nOperated under the auspices of Kuching’s North City Hall, the museum isn’t merely a kitschy tourist attraction. It’s also a scholarly place, indulging in history and global cat mythology. To distinguish itself from sleazy roadside attractions of the same theme, the museum is filled with rare, historical goodies, such as a 3,500-year-old Egyptian mummy and the world’s rarest taxidermied cat, the elusive Felis badia of Bornean fame.\n\nIf the museum wasn’t enough, Kuching is rife with cat statues and is also home to the Meow Meow Cafe. \n\n4) Pan-American Jaguar Worship\nBig cats are mostly associated with savannas and other African backdrops, but the stately jaguar is all-American. Endemic to the New World, these animals are inextricably entrenched in all sorts of Pan-American lore.\n\nJaguars are also associated with all sorts of desirable virtues like ferocity and valor. Even its name is awesome, meaning “he who kills in one fell swoop.” The Aztec, Maya, and Inca all revered the animal and enshrined it in their panoply of Gods. Temples were built to honor the jaguar’s magnificence, and the Maya even inducted the ferocious feline as their god of the underworld, complete with priests, called balam, to ordain over all death- and jaguar-related ventures.\n\nThe jaguar also features prominently in Native American legends, often as a guiding figure. In the story of the jaguar and the baby skunk, the former becomes godfather to the latter, teaching his stinky friend to “hunt.” In reality, the skunk was simply tasked with pointing out a target for the large cat to dispose of. Not realizing his limitations, the baby skunk then attempts to bring down a large elk on his own and is summarily killed.\n\n3) Japan’s Cat Islands\nAoshima is one of those rare places where cats heavily outnumber humans. The Japanese island, part of the Ehime prefecture, houses a modest fishing village with six times as many felines as humans. Feedings routinely attract a ubiquity of cats, and the island has grown popular with tourists, much to the chagrin of the few permanent human denizens.\n\nAoshima isn’t alone, either. Tashirojima Island also holds an overwhelming cat contingent, several hundred strong with only around 100 human caretakers to revel in the fluffiness. Residents revere the cats, who were enshrined on the island almost 300 years ago as mousers. Tashirojima was home to a bustling, island-wide silkworm growing operation, and the kitties were brought in to protect valuable worms from rodent predation. Later on, fishermen became so enamored with the animals that they erected a cat stupa, or shrine, at the island’s center.\n\nIf two cat islands aren’t enough for you ailurophiles out there, rest assured that Japan has at least nine other cat islands that you can visit. \n\n2) The Site Of Caesar’s Stabbing Has Been Repurposed Into A Cat Sanctuary\nFormer Roman dictator and salad namesake Gaius Julius Caesar was betrayed and killed by his colleagues at the Theater of Pompey in 44 BC. Now known as Largo di Torre Argentina, this historic site has quite unexpectedly been repurposed into a cat sanctuary.\n\nLocated about 6 meters (20 ft) under age-ravaged Roman streets, the large temple complex was unearthed when Mussolini’s crews were refurbishing the area in 1929. Over the next 80 years, the site of one of history’s most notorious murders bore witness to yet another invasion—feral cats. The multi-tiered structure was apparently irresistible to the city’s many stray cats, and they decided to aggregate within the perfectly sculpted cubbyholes and on top of immaculately shaped colonnades.\n\nRome’s total feline population is around 300,000, and the city’s laws protect cat gathering spots as urban sanctuaries. No one may disrupt any place where five or more cats have made their roost. \n\n1) Nineteenth-Century Cat Meme Photograph\nCat memes are no recent invention. As long as photography has existed, people have been gussying up their felines in human garb and posing them for elaborately staged portraits.\n\nIt all started with 19th-century British photographer and cat meme pioneer Harry Pointer, who cut his teeth taking cat pictures au naturel. That was pretty cool, but he decided that he could boost his appeal by enticing his Brighton Cats, as they came to be known, into reenacting human behaviors. We can’t vouch for his methods, as animal cruelty laws had yet to be invented, and clubbing seals was still legal, but Pointer experimented with several other animals as well. He found that pigs, dogs, and rabbits were stubbornly uncooperative, but young felines were perfectly malleable.\n\nAlmost 40 years later, in 1906, Harry Whittier Frees would achieve the next revolution in feline photography by slapping a party cap on the family cat and unknowingly birthing a new and long-lasting art form.\n\n\nCourtesy of Listverse

0193_999f0322-94e8-4265-945a-c51e22682f82	Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris wants to solve the refugee crisis in Europe by creating two new countries for those fleeing theirs \n\nNaguib Sawiris, the chief executive officer of Cairo-based Orascom Telecom Media and Technology, is worth an estimated $3 billion — he is one of Egypt’s richest men and has had one of the craziest, most ambitious ideas about how to deal with the ongoing refugee crisis plaguing Europe’s politics and infrastructure. He wants to buy two islands, fill them with fleeing refugees, provide them with jobs and give the islands a legitimate legal cover. \n\nIn a rare interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, Sawiris explained the amount of paperwork the project will require, saying, “You can’t just take people and put them on an island that you bought. You need a passport control agency. You need people to check them out. You need their data. You need customs.” The next step involves convincing Italy or Greece to part with two of the several little islands scattered around the main landmass. \n\nUpon fruition, Sawiris’ plans will involve the following numbers: Purchase cost of the islands will be anything between $10 million and $100 million, they will take in close to 100,000 to 200,000 refugees and he’s prepared to foot most of the enormous bill. \n\nIn a media release, the billionaire added more details about the venture. A communique from his office read, “Mr Sawiris has identified two privately owned Greek islands that constitute a good opportunity for the project. We have corresponded with their owners and expressed our interest to go into negotiation with them provided they can acquire the approval of the government of Greece to host the maximum number of refugees allowable according to Greek laws.” \n\nThe United Nations, meanwhile, is willing to go dutch. “Mr Sawiris has been approached by UNHCR and is going to meet with them soon to discuss possible areas of co-operation. He welcomes co-operating with the UN refugee agency, provided his idea does not get held back by any bureaucracy,” the note added. \n\nRed tape and “unnecessary criticism” are things the magnate has warned against. He has been tweeting virtually non-stop (even quoting Rabindranath Tagore) ever since his plan was announced and his social media stream targeted by “haters”. \n\nBut how is he planning to shore up so much capital to take this massive humanitarian mission off the ground? The answer is simple — he can. As it turns out, Sawiris is extremely popular in Egypt. His firm, Orascom, runs “mobile telephone networks and underwater communications networks” and is one of the country’s largest employers in the private sector. He has even founded a political party called the Al Masreyeen Al Ahrrar and is part of several of Egypt’s forefront developmental agencies. \n\nThe island buying plan has also made him famous worldwide — the married father of four claims that he has received close to 10,000 emails filled with suggestions and encouragement. “The way they (refugees) are being treated now, they are being treated like cattle. (On the islands), the main thing is investment in infrastructure. There would be temporary shelters to house the people, then you start employing the people to build housing, schools, universities and hospitals,” he told AFP. “And if things improve, whoever wants to go back (to their homeland) goes back,” he added. \n\nAmidst all this noise about “building a continent”, Sawiris has been constantly reminding the world why he’s doing this. It’s for little Aylan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy who drowned while trying to make it to Greece’s shores with his family. “That was the moment. The Gulf nations should really be pitching in or trying to help these poor people. I mean, I cannot just sit like that and just do nothing, you know, and pretend that it’s not my problem,” he said during the interview with CNN. \n\nAnd in memory of the child who died without a country, one of the proposed islands will be named ‘Aylan Island’ — a home for all those who have been displaced by war, strife, hunger and some of the greatest mistakes of 21st century humanity.

0195_edfa7034-a4e5-40f4-8b0f-b99b71babb54	(BPT) - School children are taught that after a life of action and harrowing battles, George Washington died peacefully in his bed at Mount Vernon. In fact, the nation’s first president died a slow and bloody death. In his book “Becoming George Washington,” author Steve Yoch says the founding father was a life-long believer in the efficacy of bleeding as a medical treatment. “And because of this,” explains Yoch, “Washington and his physicians virtually guaranteed his death by excessive bleeding.” \n  \nYoch says that on December 12, 1799, Washington ignored a blanket of snow and hail and mounted his horse for a five-hour tour of his farms. He chose not to change out of his wet clothes when he arrived home because dinner was ready and he did not want to inconvenience his guests. \n \nThe next morning, even though the snow had fallen even harder and he was starting to feel sick, Washington went down to the Potomac to inspect another part of his sprawling plantation. That night, he retired for the evening in a cheerful mood and said the best treatment for the cold was to “let it go as it came.” His wife Martha thought he looked terrible, but Washington chose to sit up late in the library reading. In the middle of the night, he woke Martha with throat pain and shortness of breath. Once again, he rejected medical treatment and wanted to rely on his body’s own restorative powers. \n \nIn the morning, Martha would wait no longer and called for Dr. James Craik, one of Washington’s oldest friends and a trusted physician who had served with him since the French and Indian war 40 years earlier. ”Washington always believed that bleeding improved his health,” says Yoch.  “As a young man, he frequently turned to bleeding to address his repeated illness throughout the French and Indian War and it’s only through sheer luck that his physicians didn’t kill him then.” \n \nUnfortunately, he wasn’t so lucky in December of 1799. While waiting for Dr. Craik to arrive, Washington ordered Albin Rawlins, a local clerk, to bleed him. As author Ron Chernow notes in his biography “Washington: A Life,” “When the clerk blanched, Washington gently but firmly pressed him ‘don’t be afraid’ he said. Once Rawlins had sliced into the skin, making the blood run freely, he added, ‘The orifice is not large enough.’ Martha showed better medical judgment and pleaded for a halt to the bleeding. Washington urged Rawlins on, saying ‘More, more!’ until nearly a pint of blood had been drained.” \n \nWhen Craik finally arrived, he immediately drew more blood and applied a treatment of dried beetles to Washington’s inflamed throat. Craik summoned another doctor, Elisha Cullen Dick. As soon as Dick arrived, he and Craik siphoned off even more blood, which “came very slow, was thick, and did not produce any symptoms of fainting.” \n \nHistorians estimate that Washington surrendered five pints of blood all together, or about half of his body’s total supply. Washington probably suffered from a virulent bacterial infection of the epiglottis. As it swells, the epiglottis closes off the windpipe, making breathing and swallowing extremely difficult and eventually impossible. \n \nYoch says that while Washington may have died anyway, “the loss of blood guaranteed his death.” When Washington finally ordered the bleeding to end, he reportedly said “Doctor, I die hard, but I am not afraid to go.” His last words were: “Tis well.” \n \nFor more information on George Washington’s early life and his views on bleeding visit www.becominggeorgewashington.com.  
0196_928d3c40-ab7f-4508-8633-14a2ddbd677f	Director M. Night Shyamalan, whose career has been spiraling downward since 2002’s “Signs,” doesn’t return to form with “The Visit,” but it’s still a step up for the former suspense wunderkind. In telling his story of a brother and sister’s week-long stay with their whacked-out grandparents on a Pennsylvania farm, Shyamalan (“The Sixth Sense,” “The Last Airbender,” “Lady in the Water”) delivers his two trademarks: a game-changing third-act twist and a seat-squirming broody moodiness. He also employs several red herrings in pursuit of that “big reveal,” which in some eyes will be seen as either flimsy or predictable. Mainly, Shyamalan’s spookfest suffers from an acute case of monotony. It takes place over five days, each the same as the one before, sans Nana (Tony winner Deanna Dunagan) or Pop-Pop (Peter McRobbie) periodically going off the rails. Both are not right. At night, she roams the house naked and scratches the walls. He has a problem with soiled diapers. The shock value wears off quickly. In real life, the kids would leave or call for help. But they buy Pop-Pop’s explanation: “What a bunch of confused old fools your grandparents turned out to be.” Then he warns them not to come out of their rooms after 9:30 p.m. For real. The action unfolds in a found-footage way through the lens of 15-year-old Becca (Olivia DeJonge), an aspiring documentarian, who along with her 13-year-old brother, Tyler (Ed Oxenbould), is chronicling the first-ever meeting with their estranged grandparents. The device allows Shyamalan to have some fun in a Filmmaking 101 way. There’s a lesson about ironic scores, which Shyamalan employs himself in the end. Isn’t he clever? Despite its cautionary message to let anger go, “The Visit” is thin on logic. For instance, what mother would send her kids off alone to visit people she hasn’t spoken with in 15 years? Once there, Becca is determined to discover the truth of Mom’s (Kathryn Hahn) falling out with her parents. But the central question becomes figuring out why Nana and Pop-Pop act so odd. After about 30 minutes, you don’t care, and the payoff isn’t really worth the investment. Shyamalan delivers a couple of cheap thrills, but Pop-Pop’s incontinence and Nana’s vomiting will only make you regurgitate. The other alleged thrills are all pat, like creepy characters popping up unexpectedly in the dark. The basement is off limits, until it’s not. Doors creak. Is there something in the well? The barn? Under the house? Shyamalan knows how to build suspense. In “The Visit” he’s missing the originality and truly scary inventiveness of “The Sixth Sense” and “Unbreakable.” It’s all stuff you’ve seen before. Page 2 of 2 - Dunagan and McRobbie provide plenty of campy creepiness. As a newly divorced mom, Hahn, a Judd Apatow veteran, is serviceable if a tad miscast. The kids are scarred by their dad’s sudden departure. DeJonge does the de rigueur precocious kid in peril. Oxenbould provides moments of levity as Tyler, the aspiring actor. The real laughs, however unintentional, come when Shyamalan gets serious. In the end, “The Visit” goes nowhere.

0197_3c141c48-2649-42ac-9b53-14ab0550e6b1	"- As morcellator cancer lawsuits continue to be filed around the country, The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has agreed to investigate claims that laparoscopic power morcellators spread cancer during gynecological surgeries after a request from Congress. Southern Med Law continues to represent women across the country who are believed to have had undetected uterine cancer spread after gynecological procedures involving power morcellators and had filed and settled the first power morcellator cancer lawsuit in a U.S. federal court for an undisclosed amount. (In Re: Power Morcellator Litigation, MDL Case No. 78) \nGAO’s managing director, Katherine Siggerud, sent a response on September 1 to U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), who led the12-member bipartisan Congressional group in asking for the probe. The GAO conducts investigations for the U.S. Congress. According to a report by Philly.com, Ms. Siggerud wrote, ""GAO accepts your request as work that is within the scope of its authority."" The legislators sent a letter to the GAO on August 7 noting that, ""hundreds, if not thousands, of women in America are dead"" because of power morcellators. The legislators asked the GAO to determine, among other things, whether the FDA’s expedited approval process for medical devices ""sufficiently identified"" the cancer risks before the power morcellators entered the marketplace. \n\n""Southern Med Law looks forward to the outcome of the GAO’s investigation because the law firm is representing women who have been seriously or fatally injured allegedly by power morcellators,"" says Dr. François Blaudeau, founder of Southern Med Law. In July, Dr. Blaudeau settled the first power morcellator cancer lawsuit filed in federal court on behalf of a Pennsylvania widower, Scott Burkhart, whose wife, Donna Burkhart, 53, died of disseminated leiomyosarcoma in February 2013. Donna Burkhart developed the cancer after undergoing a power morcellator hysterectomy in March 2012. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, against morcellator manufacturers, LiNA Medical APS, Kebomed AB & LiNA Medical US. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount.(Case No. 5:14-cv-1557) \n\nThe law firm explains that laparoscopic power morcellators are used during a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) and a myomectomy (removal of uterine fibroids). The device grinds uterine tissue into pieces so that the fragments can be removed through small (laparoscopic) incisions in the abdomen. It is during the removal of uterine tissue that undetected cancer cells are spread into the peritoneal cavity. \n\nIn November 2014, the FDA warned that power morcellators should be avoided in the majority of women who require a hysterectomy and a myomectomy due to the medical device’s potential to spread undetected cancer cells which greatly reduced a woman’s chances for long-term survival. The law firm notes that after the FDA’s announcement, national health insurance companies including Aetna Inc. and UnitedHealth, announced that they would either end or restrict coverage for uterine morcellation procedures. Additionally, in the wake of the FDA’s warning, the FBI decided to investigate power morcellators. According to CBS News, the FBI’s probe includes questioning Johnson & Johnson, the largest power morcellator manufacturer, on what it knew about the cancer risks associated with the morcellators. Johnson & Johnson suspended global sales of the devices after the FDA’s warning. \n\nCourt documents indicate that the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) will hear oral arguments on October 1 on a request from six plaintiffs who filed a request to consolidate all federally filed power morcellator cancer lawsuits. The plaintiffs are asking the panel to transfer 22 pending morcellator lawsuits, and those that are subsequently filed, to the U.S. District Court, District of Kansas. The plaintiffs, who filed claims against various morcellator manufacturers, asked for a consolidation because all the complaints allege that power morcellators used during gynecological procedures can spread and upstage cancer. (In Re: Power Morcellator Litigation, MDL Case No. 78) \n\nAbout Southern Med Law And Filing A Morcellator Cancer Lawsuit \nSouthern Med Law and Dr. François Blaudeau possess a unique understanding of the medical and legal questions at issue in power morcellator cancer lawsuit claims. It is this in-depth knowledge that is tantamount to a successful legal representation that protects the rights of the injured. The staff at Southern Med Law is not only trained in successfully handling your legal needs but also understand the pain and suffering and treatment from a medical point of view, and is committed to protecting the rights of all individuals.

0198_6d9f69af-c42b-4137-ba13-94e72ff9ef6c	Text smaller   Text bigger    \n\n \nRepublican members of Congress have overcome attempts by abortionists to keep secret the statements they made to undercover investigators looking into Planned Parenthood’s body-parts business. \n    \nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Health Care, Benefits and Administrative Rule has issued a subpoena for the full and unedited videos made by the Center for Medical Progress , according to the committee’s chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. \n \nCMP created a fake company that purported to buy body parts of aborted babies and sell them to researchers. \n \nOver several years, CMP secretly recorded conversations with Planned Parenthood officials who engaged in negotiation for body parts and candidly discussed gruesome aspects of the trade. \n \nJordan said the recently released undercover Planned Parenthood videos are “beyond disturbing.” \n \n“They are outright appalling, and show activity that is not only morally wrong, but appears to be potentially illegal as well,” he said. \n \nRead the tested and proven strategies to defeat the abortion cartel, in “Abortion Free: Your Manual for Building a Pro-Life America One Community at a Time.” \n \n“These videos raise serious questions about this organization’s use of taxpayer funds that cannot go unanswered. It is our duty as members of Congress to ensure taxpayer money is not misused. This subpoena creates a legal obligation that ensures that a judge in Northern California cannot stand in the way of congressional investigations into this matter.” \n \nHe explained that for Congress to make informed decisions about its use of taxpayer dollars, “it is vital that we review the unedited videos to understand the whole truth.” \n \nJudge William Orrick of San Francisco had blocked the release of some of the videos in response to a complaint from the National Abortion Federation, whose leaders are on record in the videos. \n \nAs part of the case, lawyers for CMP and its founder, David Daleiden, on Wednesday went to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to file a mandamus action. \n \nThe filing explains CMP conducted a 30-month undercover investigation of the practice of buying and selling fetal tissue within the abortion industry. \n \n“Their investigation revealed evidence of widespread criminal practices in the industry, including the selling of fetal tissue for profit, the alteration of abortion methods to procure better fetal tissue specimens, the collection of intact fetuses born with beating hearts for research purposes, and the procurement of fetal tissue for research without patients’ knowledge and consent,” the order said. “Each of these practices is a crime under federal law.” \n \nNAF sued Daleiden and CMP “in an attempt to silence free speech on the abortion industry’s sale of fetal body parts,” lawyers from the Thomas More Society said on behalf of CMP. \n \nThe filing with the appeals court followed an unsuccessful effort at the district court to have NAF’s complaint dismissed under California’s anti-SLAPP law. \n \nThe “point of the anti-SLAPP statute is that you have a right not to be dragged through the courts because you exercised your constitutional rights,” the legal team explained. \n \nThe lawyers told the appeals judges, “This case involves an extraordinary gag order, followed by an equally extraordinary discovery order.” \n \nThe district court’s order prevents Daleiden “from speaking publicly on matters of paramount public interest that have dominated national headlines for weeks.” \n \nAnd its discovery decision ordered the center “to participate in burdensome and intrusive discovery relating to a motion for preliminary injunction.” \n \n“This court should hold that the district court’s order compelling CMP to participate in discovery must be dissolved for two independent reasons: (1) no discovery is necessary to resolve the pending motion for preliminary injunction, because any injunction in this case would manifestly violate the First Amendment’s ironclad prohibition on prior restraints on free speech; and (2) California law, applicable in federal court … requires the district court to rule on the anti-SLAPP motion prior to conducting discovery in the case.” \n \nIn a similar, separate ruling, another court previously determined that the First Amendment allowed CMP to release the disputed videos. \n \nBut the congressional subpoena means the videos can be forwarded to Congress for its purposes – whether or not a California judge is suppressing them. \n \nWND has reported on the videos – 10 so far – as they have been released. They are posted online. \n \nThe most recent showed the abortionists were aware of how bad it would look if word got out about their baby-parts business. \n \n“This is important,” said Vanessa Cullins, the vice president of external medical affairs for Planned Parenthood. “This could destroy your organization and us, if we don’t time those conversations correctly.” \n \nAnd Deborah VanDerhei, the national director of Planned Parenthood ‘s Consortium of Abortion Providers, said, “Think New York Times headline when you’re creating your policy.” \n \nShe explained it’s an issue “you might imagine that we’re not that comfortable talking about on emails.” \n \n“And so we want to have the conversation in person,” VanDerhei said. \n \n“I think a congressional hearing from, you know, scared the bejeezus out of people 15 years ago … so we just want to not have to repeat that again.” \n \nRead the tested and proven strategies to defeat the abortion cartel, in “Abortion Free: Your Manual for Building a Pro-Life America One Community at a Time.” \n \nCMP noted the sale or purchase of human fetal tissue is a federal felony punishable by up to 10 yeas in prison or a fine of up to $500,000. \n \nSee the most recent video: \n Please enable Javascript to watch this video    Click here for reuse options!
