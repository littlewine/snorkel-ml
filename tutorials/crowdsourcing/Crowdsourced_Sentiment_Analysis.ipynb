    "\n",

    "1. Loading data via SparkSQL\n",

    "1. [weather-non-agg-DFE.csv](data/weather-non-agg-DFE.csv) contains the raw contributor answers for each of the 1,000 tweets.\n",
    "2. [weather-evaluated-agg-DFE.csv](data/weather-evaluated-agg-DFE.csv) contains gold sentiment labels by trusted workers for each of the 1,000 tweets."
